{{George H. W. Bush series}}
'''George Herbert Walker Bush''' (born June 12, 1924) is an American politician who served as the 41st [[President of the United States]] from 1989 to 1993. Prior to assuming the presidency, Bush served as the [[List of Vice Presidents of the United States|43rd Vice President of the United States]] from 1981 to 1989. A member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], he had previously been a Congressman, Ambassador and [[Director of Central Intelligence]]. During his career in [[public sector|public service]], he was known simply as George Bush; since 2001, he has often been referred to as "George H. W. Bush", "Bush 41", or "George Bush Senior" in order to distinguish him from his eldest son, [[George W. Bush]], the 43rd president of the United States. He is the nation's oldest [[Living Presidents of the United States|living president and vice president]], as well as the [[List of Presidents of the United States by age|longest-lived president]] in history.

A member of the [[Bush family]], he was born in [[Milton, Massachusetts]] to [[Prescott Bush]] and Dorothy Walker Bush. Following the attack on [[Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941, Bush postponed his university studies, enlisted in the [[U.S. Navy]] on his 18th birthday, and became the youngest [[naval aviator|aviator]] in the U.S. Navy at the time. He served until September 1945, then attended [[Yale University]]. Graduating in 1948, he moved his family to [[West Texas]], where he entered the [[oil business]] and became a millionaire by the age of 40 in 1964. Soon after founding his own oil company, Bush became involved in politics and won election to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] from [[Texas' 7th congressional district|Texas' 7th district]] in 1966. In 1971, President [[Richard Nixon]] appointed Bush as [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations|Ambassador to the United Nations]], and in 1973, Bush became the [[Chairman of the Republican National Committee]]. The following year, President [[Gerald Ford]] appointed Bush as the ambassador to [[China]] and later reassigned Bush to the position of [[Director of Central Intelligence]]. Bush ran for president in [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980]] but was defeated in the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1980|Republican primary]] by [[Ronald Reagan]]. Reagan chose Bush as his running mate, and Bush became vice president after the Reagan–Bush ticket won the 1980 election. During his eight-year tenure as vice president, Bush headed administration task forces on deregulation and fighting the [[War on Drugs]].

In [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988]], Bush ran [[George H. W. Bush presidential campaign, 1988|a successful campaign to succeed Reagan as President]], defeating [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] opponent [[Michael Dukakis]]. [[Foreign policy]] drove the Bush presidency: [[military operations]] were conducted [[United States invasion of Panama|in Panama]] and [[Gulf War|the Persian Gulf]]; the [[Berlin Wall]] fell in 1989, and the [[Soviet Union]] dissolved two years later. Though the agreement was not ratified until after he left office, Bush also signed the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), which created a [[trade bloc]] consisting of the United States, [[Canada]], and [[Mexico]]. Domestically, Bush [[Read my lips: no new taxes|reneged on a 1988 campaign promise]] and, after a struggle with Congress, signed an increase in taxes that Congress had passed. In the wake of a weak recovery from an [[Early 1990s recession|economic recession]], along with continuing budget deficits and the diminution of foreign politics as a major issue in a post-Cold War [[political climate]], he lost the [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992 presidential election]] to Democrat [[Bill Clinton]].

Bush left office in 1993. His [[George Bush Presidential Library|presidential library]] was dedicated in 1997, and he has been active—often alongside Bill Clinton—in various humanitarian activities. With George W. Bush's victory in the 2000 presidential election, Bush and his son became the second father–son combination to serve as president, following [[John Adams]] and [[John Quincy Adams]]. Bush's second son, [[Jeb Bush]], served as the [[List of Governors of Florida|43rd]] Governor of Florida from 1999 to 2007.

George Herbert Walker Bush was born at 173 Adams Street in [[Milton, Massachusetts]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidentialavenue.com/gb.cfm|title=Presidential Avenue: George Bush|accessdate=March 29, 2008|publisher=Presidential Avenue|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008144507/http://www.presidentialavenue.com/gb.cfm|archive-date=October 8, 2007|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; on June 12, 1924, to [[Prescott Bush|Prescott Sheldon Bush]] and Dorothy (Walker) Bush. The Bush family moved from Milton to [[Greenwich, Connecticut]], shortly after his birth. Growing up, he used the nickname "Poppy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eun Kyung Kim |url=http://www.today.com/parents/jenna-bush-hager-welcomes-second-daughter-named-after-george-h-t31121 |title=Jenna Bush Hager welcomes second daughter — named after George H.W.

Bush, whose nickname growing up was "Poppy."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush began his formal education at the [[Greenwich Country Day School]] in Greenwich. Beginning in 1938, he attended [[Phillips Academy]] in [[Andover, Massachusetts]], where he held a number of leadership positions that included president of the senior class, secretary of the student council, president of the community fund-raising group, a member of the editorial board of the school newspaper, and captain of both the varsity baseball and soccer teams.&lt;ref name="andover"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andover.edu/news/bush.htm|title=Former President George Bush honored at his 60th reunion at Phillips Academy, Andover|date=June 8, 2002|accessdate=March 29, 2008|publisher=Phillips Academy|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080401131455/http://www.andover.edu/news/bush.htm |archivedate = April 1, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States formally entered World War II in December 1941, following [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]'s surprise [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in [[Hawaii]]. Six months later, Bush enlisted into the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]]&lt;ref name="navy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq10-1.htm |title=Lieutenant Junior Grade George Bush, USNR |date=April 6, 2001 |accessdate=March 29, 2008 |publisher=Naval Historical Center |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100410115448/http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq10-1.htm |archivedate=April 10, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; immediately after he graduated from [[Phillips Academy]] on his eighteenth birthday. He became a [[naval aviator]], taking training for [[aircraft carrier]] operations aboard [[USS Sable (IX-81)|USS ''Sable'']].&lt;ref name="andover"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| vauthors =| title = The Greater Buffalo &amp; The U.S.S.

In September 1943, he was assigned to Torpedo Squadron 51 (VT-51) as the photographic officer.&lt;ref name="navy"/&gt; The following year, his squadron was based in {{USS|San Jacinto|CVL-30|6}} as a member of Air Group 51, where his lanky physique earned him the nickname "Skin".&lt;ref name="Skin"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hamptonroads.com/2009/01/san-jacinto-veterans-reunite-recall-serving-bush|title=San Jacinto veterans reunite, recall the one they called 'Skin'|last=Adams|first=Kathy|date=January 10, 2009|work=The Virginian Pilot|publisher=Landmark Communications|accessdate=January 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, the task force was victorious in one of the largest air battles of World War II: the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]].&lt;ref name="navy"/&gt;

After Bush's promotion to [[lieutenant (junior grade)]] on August 1, 1944, ''San Jacinto'' commenced operations against the Japanese in the [[Bonin Islands]]. Bush piloted one of four [[Grumman TBM Avenger]]s of VT-51 that attacked the Japanese installations on [[Chichijima]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0312/20/cp.00.html Story of George H. W. Bush World War II Experience]". [[CNN]]. December 20, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; His crew for the mission, which occurred on September 2, 1944, included Radioman Second Class John Delaney and Lt.(jg) William White.&lt;ref name="navy"/&gt; During their attack, the Avengers encountered intense [[Anti-aircraft artillery|anti-a]] fire; Bush's aircraft was hit by [[flak]] and his engine caught fire. Despite the fire in his aircraft, Bush completed his attack and released bombs over his target, scoring several damaging hits.&lt;ref name="navy"/&gt; With his engine ablaze, Bush flew several miles from the island, where he and one other crew member of the TBM bailed out;&lt;ref name="maam"/&gt; the other man's [[parachute]] did not open.&lt;ref name="navy"/&gt; Bush waited for four hours in an inflated raft, while several fighters circled protectively overhead, until he was rescued by the submarine {{USS|Finback|SS-230|6}}, on lifeguard duty.&lt;ref name="navy"/&gt; For the next month, he remained in ''Finback'' and participated in the rescue of other aviators. Several of those shot down during the attack were executed, and their livers were [[Chichijima incident|eaten]] by their captors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bradley|first1=James|title=Flyboys|date=2003|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|isbn=978-0-316-10584-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This experience shaped Bush profoundly, leading him to ask, "Why had I been spared and what did God have for me?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.christianpost.com/news/the-faith-of-george-h-w-bush-189108/|title=The Faith of George HW Bush}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:George H.W. Bush seated in a Grumman TBM Avenger, circa 1944 (H069-13).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bush in his TBM aboard ''San Jacinto'' in  1944]]
In November 1944, Bush returned to ''San Jacinto'' and participated in operations in the Philippines until his squadron was replaced and sent home to the United States. Through 1944, he flew 58 combat missions&lt;ref name="maam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maam.org/flightsim/news/tbm_history.htm|title=History's Youngest Naval Aviator: George H. W.

His final assignment was as to a new torpedo squadron, VT-153, based at [[Naval Air Station Grosse Ile]], Michigan. Bush was [[Military discharge|honorably discharged]] from the U.S. Navy in September 1945, one month after the [[Victory over Japan Day|surrender of Japan].&lt;ref name=GHWBlifebefore&gt;{{cite web| title=George H.

==Marriage and college years==
When Bush was still in the Navy, he married [[Barbara Bush|Barbara Pierce]] (1925–2018) in [[Rye, New York]] on January 6, 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Markovich |first=Jeremy |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/george-hw-bush-and-barbara-pierce-are-wed-jan-6-1945-233101 |title=George H.W. Bush and Barbara Pierce are wed: Jan. 6, 1945 |publisher=Politico |date=January 6, 2017 |accessdate=November 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage produced six children: [[George W. Bush|George W.]] (b. 1946), [[Pauline Robinson Bush|Robin]] (1949–1953), [[Jeb Bush|Jeb]] (b. 1953), [[Neil Bush|Neil]] (b. 1955), [[Marvin Bush|Marvin]] (b. 1956), and [[Dorothy Bush Koch|Doro]] (b. 1959).&lt;ref name=GHWBlifebefore/&gt; At the time of his wife's death on April 17, 2018, George H. W. had been married to Barbara for 73 years; theirs was the longest presidential marriage in American history. They had become the longest-married presidential couple in January 1999 when their marriage surpassed the 54 year (1764–1818) marriage of [[John Adams|John]] and [[Abigail Adams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title='You were the reason': Barbara and George Bush's love story remembered at her funeral| first=Rachel| last=Siegel| date=April 22, 2018| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2018/04/22/you-were-the-reason-barbara-and-george-bushs-historic-love-story-hailed-at-her-funeral/?noredirect=on| work=The Washington Post| accessdate=April 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Bush received his military discharge, he enrolled at [[Yale University]]. He earned an undergraduate degree in economics on an accelerated program that enabled him to graduate in two and a half years, rather than the usual four.&lt;ref name=GHWBlifebefore/&gt; He was a member of the [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]] fraternity and was elected its president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/12/books/41-george-w-bushs-portrait-of-george-h-w-bush.html |title=Love Flows, President to President |newspaper=New York Times |date=November 11, 2014 |first=Michiko |last=Kakutani |accessdate=November 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also captained the Yale baseball team and played in the first two [[College World Series]] as a left-handed [[first baseman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=School House to White House: The Education of the Presidents| url=https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2007/spring/schoolhouse.html| date=Spring 2007| publisher=National Archives| location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=March 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush was the team captain during his senior year in 1948, and he met [[Babe Ruth]] before a game; the event took place only weeks before Ruth's death. Like his father, he was also a member of the Yale cheerleading squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2008/01/28/cheerleading-of-the-20s-epitome-of-masculinity/ |title=Cheerleading of the '20s: Epitome of masculinity |work=Yale Daily News |first=Simone |last=Berkower |accessdate=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Late in his junior year, he was initiated into the [[Skull and Bones]] [[secret society]]; his father [[Prescott Bush]] had been initiated into the same society in 1917.  He was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]] when he graduated from Yale in 1948 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics.&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/kbank/profiles/bush/|title=George Herbert Walker Bush|publisher=CNN|accessdate=March 29, 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080308132103/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/kbank/profiles/bush/ |archivedate = March 8, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Faith==
Bush's Christian faith was shaped by his upbringing in the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]], though by the end of his life his apparent religious beliefs have been considered more in line with [[Evangelical Christian]] doctrine and practices. Several key moments in Bush's life led to a deepening of his faith in [[Jesus Christ]], including his narrow escape from Japanese forces in 1944 and the tragic death of his three-year-old child, Robin, in 1953. This strong faith would inspire many themes that later would become apparent in his public life, such as his [[Thousand Points of Light]] speech, his support for [[prayer in schools]], and his strong support of the [[pro-life movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.christianpost.com/news/the-faith-of-george-h-w-bush-189108/|title=The Faith of George HW Bush|author=Gary S. Smith|date=June 26, 2017|accessdate=June 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his wife's death in April 2018, Bush released a statement through his spokesman, saying in part, "We have faith she is in heaven, and we know life will go on - as she would have it. So cross the Bushes off your worry list."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abc13.com/society/she-is-in-heaven---president-george-hw-bush-/3358726/|title="How is 41?"

==Early political career (1963–1980)==
===Congressional years (1967–1971)===
[[File:George H. W. Bush 91st Congress.jpg|thumb|Bush in 1969]]
Bush's career in politics began in 1963 when he was elected chairman of the [[Harris County, Texas]] Republican Party. The following year, he ran against incumbent Democrat [[Ralph W. Yarborough]] in the [[United States Senate election in Texas, 1964|U.S. Senate race]]. He presented himself as a young Conservative Republican in contrast to the aging liberal Democrat Yarborough. He campaigned against civil rights legislation pending before Congress, stating that he believed it gave too much power to the federal government.&lt;ref name=GHWVB&gt;{{cite book| last=Naftali| first=Timothy| date=2007| title=George H.

Johnson]].&lt;ref name="GHWVB"/&gt;

Bush and the Harris County Republicans played a role in the development of the new Republican Party of the late 20th century. First, Bush worked to absorb the [[John Birch Society]] members, who were trying to take over the Republican Party. Second, during and after the [[civil rights movement]], Democrats in the South who were committed to [[racial segregation|segregation]] left their party, and although the "country club Republicans" had differing ideological beliefs, they found common ground in hoping to expel the Democrats from power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/transcript/bush-transcript/ |title=Program Transcript.

[[File:George Herbert Walker Bush and Eisenhower 1.jpg|thumb|left|President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] with Bush]]
In 1966, Bush was elected to a seat in the [[United States House of Representatives]] from the [[Texas' 7th congressional district|7th District of Texas]]; he won 57 percent of the ballots cast in a race against Democrat Frank Briscoe, who was the district attorney of Harris County.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=47440|title=TX District 07|publisher=Our Campaigns|accessdate=March 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Ex-DA-Frank-Briscoe-legal-heavyweight-for-1689920.php|title=Ex-DA Frank Briscoe, legal heavyweight for decades, dies at 84, January 5, 2011|publisher=''[[Houston Chronicle]]''|accessdate=March 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush was the first Republican to represent Houston in the U.S. House.&lt;ref name="ea"/&gt; Bush's representative district included [[Tanglewood, Houston|Tanglewood]], the Houston neighborhood that was his residence;&lt;ref name=Hickey&gt;Hickey, Elisabeth.

He supported the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon administration]]'s [[Vietnam War|Vietnam policies]], but broke with Republicans on the issue of [[birth control]], which he supported.&lt;ref name="ea"/&gt; Despite being a first-term congressman, Bush was appointed to the powerful [[House Ways and Means Committee]], where he voted to abolish the [[military draft]].&lt;ref name="msn"/&gt; He was elected to a second term in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=180430|title=TX District 7|publisher=Our Campaigns|accessdate=March 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, Nixon convinced Bush to relinquish his House seat in order to [[United States Senate election in Texas, 1970|run for the Senate]] against Ralph Yarborough, who was a fierce Nixon critic. In the Republican primary, Bush easily defeated conservative [[Robert J. Morris]] by a margin of 87.6% to 12.4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=278800|title= TX US Senate – R Primary|publisher=Our Campaigns|accessdate=March 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nixon came to [[Longview, Texas]] to campaign for Bush and gubernatorial candidate [[Paul Eggers]], a [[Dallas]] lawyer who was a close friend of U.S. Senator [[John G.

===Ambassador to the United Nations (1971–1973)===
[[File:George Bush as United Nations Representative, 1971-72 - NARA - 186386.tif|thumb|Bush as ambassador to the United Nations, 1971]]
Following his 1970 loss, Bush was well known as a prominent Republican businessman from the "[[Sun Belt]]", a group of states in the Southern part of the country.&lt;ref name="msn"/&gt; Nixon noticed and appreciated the sacrifice Bush had made of his Congressional position,&lt;ref name="ea"/&gt; so he appointed him [[United States Ambassadors to the United Nations|Ambassador to the United Nations]].&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt; He was confirmed unanimously by the Senate, and served for two years, beginning in 1971.&lt;ref name="ea"/&gt;

===Chairman of the Republican National Committee (1973–1974)===
Amidst the [[Watergate scandal]], Nixon asked Bush to become chairman of the [[Republican National Committee]] in 1973.&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt; Bush accepted, and held this position when the popularity of both Nixon and the Republican Party plummeted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nixon.archives.gov/thelife/apolitician/thepresident/index.php|title=The President (Richard Nixon)|publisher=Richard Nixon Presidential Library|accessdate=March 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defended Nixon steadfastly, but later as Nixon's complicity became clear, Bush focused more on defending the Republican Party, while still maintaining loyalty to Nixon. As chairman, Bush formally requested that Nixon eventually resign for the good of the Republican party.&lt;ref name="ea"/&gt; Nixon did this on August 9, 1974; Bush noted in his diary that "There was an aura of sadness, like somebody died.... The [resignation] speech was vintage Nixon—a kick or two at the press—enormous strains. One couldn't help but look at the family and the whole thing and think of his accomplishments and then think of the shame.... [President Gerald Ford's swearing-in offered] indeed a new spirit, a new lift."&lt;ref name="bushdiary"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/060716/16bushonnixon_eye.htm |title=George HW on Nixon resignation |date=July 16, 2006 |accessdate=March 29, 2008 |work=US News and World Report |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624230333/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/060716/16bushonnixon_eye.htm |archivedate=June 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Envoy to China (1974–1975)===
[[File:George Bush as United States Liaison to China, 1974-1975 - NARA - 186378.tif|thumb|upright=0.7|Bush as United States Liaison to China, circa 1975]]
President [[Gerald Ford]] appointed Bush to be Chief of the [[De facto embassy#China and the United States|U.S. Liaison Office]] in the [[People's Republic of China]]. Since the United States at the time maintained official relations with the [[Republic of China on Taiwan]] and not the People's Republic of China, the Liaison Office did not have the official status of an embassy and Bush did not formally hold the position of "ambassador", though he unofficially acted as one. The 14 months that he spent in China were largely seen as beneficial for [[U.S.-China relations]].&lt;ref name="ea"/&gt;

After Ford assumed the presidency, Bush was under serious consideration for being nominated as vice president. Ford eventually narrowed his list to [[Nelson Rockefeller]] and Bush. [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] reportedly preferred Rockefeller over Bush. Rockefeller was finally named and confirmed.&lt;ref name="senate"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/george_bush.pdf|format=PDF|title=Vice Presidents of the United States: George H.

Bush was again passed over for the vice presidency by Ford when the president chose Bush's future presidential rival, Senator [[Bob Dole]], to replace Rockefeller on the 1976 presidential ticket.

===Other positions (1977–1981)===

==1980 presidential campaign==
{{See also|United States presidential election, 1980}}
[[File:Bush80.gif|thumb|right|1980 campaign logo]]
Bush had decided in the late 1970s that he was going to run for president in 1980; in 1979, he attended 850 political events ("[[cattle call]]s") and traveled more than {{convert|250000|mi|km}} to campaign for the nation's highest office. In the contest for the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] nomination, Bush stressed his wide range of government experience, while competing against rivals Senator [[Howard Baker]] of Tennessee, Senator [[Bob Dole]] of Kansas, Congressman [[John B. Anderson|John Anderson]] of Illinois (who would later run as an independent), Congressman [[Phil Crane]], also of Illinois, former Governor [[John Connally]] of Texas, former Minnesota Governor [[Harold Stassen]], and the front-runner [[Ronald Reagan]], former actor, and [[Governor of California]].&lt;ref name="senate"/&gt;

[[File:Reagan-Bush Nashua 1980 debate.jpg|thumb|left|Ronald Reagan, moderator John Breen, and Bush participate in the Nashua, New Hampshire Presidential Debate, 1980]]
At the outset of the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1980|1980 primary race]], Bush focused heavily on winning the January 21 [[Iowa caucuses]]; five months earlier he had won the [[Iowa Straw Poll]]. Reagan, however, far ahead in the polls, campaigned little. Bush represented the centrist wing in the GOP, whereas Reagan represented conservatives. Bush famously labeled Reagan's [[supply-side economics|supply side]]-influenced plans for massive [[tax cut]]s "[[Reaganomics|voodoo economics]]". His strategy proved useful, to some degree, as he won in Iowa with 31.5% to Reagan's 29.4%. After the win, Bush stated that his campaign was full of momentum, or "[[the Big Mo]]".

As a result of the loss, Reagan replaced his [[campaign manager]], reorganized his staff, and concentrated on the [[New Hampshire primary]]. The two men agreed to a debate in the state, organized by the ''[[Nashua Telegraph]]'', but paid for by the Reagan campaign. Reagan invited the other four candidates as well, but Bush refused to debate them, and eventually they left. The debate proved to be a pivotal moment in the campaign; when the moderator, John Breen, ordered Reagan's microphone turned off, his angry response, "I am paying for this microphone," struck a chord with the public. Bush ended up losing New Hampshire's primary with 23% to Reagan's 50%. Bush lost most of the remaining primaries as well, and formally dropped out of the race in May of that year.&lt;ref name="senate"/&gt;

With his political future in doubt, Bush sold his house in Houston and bought his grandfather's estate in [[Kennebunkport, Maine|Kennebunkport]], Maine, known as "Walker's Point".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901EFDD1630F93BA35754C0A9649C8B63|work=The New York Times|accessdate=April 2, 2008|date=July 8, 2002|author=Bumiller, Elisabeth|title=White House Letter; At Parents' Home, Bush Resumes Role of Son}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[1980 Republican National Convention|Republican Convention]], Reagan selected Bush as his vice presidential nominee, placing him on the winning [[United States presidential election, 1980|Republican presidential ticket of 1980]].

==Vice presidency (1981–1989)==
{{See also|Presidency of Ronald Reagan}}

===First term, 1981–1985===
As vice president, Bush generally maintained a typically low profile while he recognized the constitutional limits of the office; he avoided decision-making or criticizing Reagan in any way. As had become customary, he and his wife moved into the Vice President's residence at [[Number One Observatory Circle]], about two miles from the [[White House]]. After selling the house in [[Tanglewood, Houston|Tanglewood]], the Bushes declared a room in [[The Houstonian Hotel]] in [[Houston]] as their official voting address.&lt;ref name=Hickey/&gt; The Bushes attended a large number of public and ceremonial events in their positions, including many [[state funeral]]s, which became a common joke for comedians. Mrs. Bush found the funerals largely beneficial, saying, "George met with many current or future heads of state at the funerals he attended, enabling him to forge personal relationships that were important to President Reagan." As the [[President of the Senate]], Bush stayed in contact with members of Congress and kept the president informed on occurrences on Capitol Hill.&lt;ref name="senate"/&gt;

[[File:Photograph of the Official Portrait of President Reagan and Vice-President Bush - NARA - 198518.jpg|thumb|left|President [[Ronald Reagan]] with Bush]]
On March 30, 1981 (early into the administration), [[Reagan assassination attempt|Reagan was shot]] and seriously wounded by [[John Hinckley Jr.]] in Washington, D.C. Bush was in [[Fort Worth]], Texas, and immediately flew back to Washington because he was next in line to the presidency. Reagan's cabinet convened in the [[White House Situation Room]], where they discussed various issues, including the availability of the [[Nuclear Football]]. When Bush's plane landed, he was advised by his aides to proceed directly to the White House by helicopter as an image of the government still functioning despite the attack. Bush rejected the idea, responding, "Only the President lands on the South Lawn."&lt;ref name="senate"/&gt; This made a positive impression on Reagan,&lt;ref name="senate"/&gt; who recovered and returned to work within two weeks. From then on, the two men would have regular Thursday lunches in the [[Oval Office]].

During a [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] Republican fundraiser in June 1981, Bush stated that President Reagan was unwilling to make additional tax cut compromises with Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/06/19/Vice-President-George-Bush-says-President-Reagan-has-made/7222361771200/|title=Vice President George Bush says President Reagan has made...|publisher=UPI|date=June 19, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1981, Bush traveled to [[Mexico]] to participate in Independence Day celebrations there. He said in a statement that President Reagan was "deeply committed to strengthening the friendship and cooperation between our countries".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/09/15/Vice-president-arrives-in-Mexico/3124369374400/|title=Vice president arrives in Mexico|first=Paul|last=Koloski|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1981, Bush toured western Texas to offer support for beleaguered Director of the [[Office of Management and Budget]] [[David Stockman]], who he believed was intelligent but needed to adjust to managing journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/11/14/Vice-President-George-Bush-is-giving-tentative-support-to/6505374562000/|title=Vice President George Bush is giving tentative support to...|publisher=UPI|date=November 14, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a December 1981 interview, Bush stated that he was convinced news leaks by unnamed administration officials were correct and had succeeded in hurting President Reagan: "I really feel we have been undisciplined in this White House. We've not served the president well by these leaks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/12/06/Vice-President-George-Bush-noting-the-Reagan-White-House/6894376462800/|title=Vice President George Bush, noting the Reagan White House...|date=December 6, 1981|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 28, 1982, Bush met with [[Prime Minister of Singapore]] [[Lee Kuan Yew]] for a wide-ranging discussion that included speaking about regional security, the world economy, and Soviet expansionism in Southeast Asia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/04/28/Vice-President-George-Bush-Wednesday-wound-up-wide-ranging-talks/8730388814400/|title=Vice President George Bush Wednesday wound up wide-ranging talks...|first=Arthur|last=Richards|publisher=UPI|date=April 28, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later that month, Bush confirmed he was considering traveling to China during his impending trip to Asia and the Pacific amid a news conference in [[Seoul, South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/27/world/bush-in-seoul-hints-of-trip-to-peking.html|title=BUSH, IN SEOUL, HINTS OF TRIP TO PEKING|first=Henry Scott|last=Stokes|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 27, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1982, Bush toured [[Africa]], the first instance of American government visiting there since the Reagan administration began. Bush told reporters that while he would allow for heads of state to dictate how each meeting would transpire, there was an expectation on his part for discussions on the independence of [[Namibia]], adding that the US was going to retain the position of no settlement in Namibia until Cuban troops in [[Angola]] were withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/11/10/Vice-President-George-Bush-acting-as-the-presidents-personal/4018405752400/|title=Vice President George Bush, acting as the president's personal...|first=Jim|last=Anderson|date=November 10, 1982|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 15, Bush met with [[United States Secretary of State]] [[George P. Shultz]] and [[Yuri Andropov]] in [[Moscow, Russia]] to discuss human rights and arms reductions. Bush later said, "The meeting was frank, cordial and substantive. It gave both sides the opportunity to exchange views on the state of their relations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/11/15/Vice-President-George-Bush-and-Secretary-of-State-George/2659406184400/|title=Vice President George Bush and Secretary of State George...|first=Steven R.|last=Reed|date=November 15, 1982|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of January 1983, Bush began a seven-day tour of West Europe intended to promote the arms reduction commitment being advocated for by the Reagan administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/31/world/bush-starts-7-nation-trip-in-bonn-aim-is-to-reassure-allies-on-arms.html|title=BUSH STARTS 7-NATION TRIP IN BONN; AIM IS TO REASSURE ALLIES ON ARMS|date=January 31, 1983|first=James M.|last=Markham|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a February 8 news conference in Paris, Bush said the US's invitations for the Soviet Union to consent to a reduction in medium-range missiles were supported by Western Europe, which he stated had also consented to the deployment of new American missiles starting in the latter part of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/09/world/bush-in-paris-says-allies-commitment-on-missiles-remains-firm.html|title=BUSH, IN PARIS, SAYS ALLIES' COMMITMENT ON MISSILES REMAINS FIRM|first=John|last=Vinocur|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, Bush defended American nuclear arms policy when answering British Secretary General of the Committee on Nuclear Disarmament [[Bruce Kent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/10/world/bush-in-london-challenged-by-nuclear-foe.html|title=BUSH, IN LONDON, CHALLENGED BY NUCLEAR FOE|first=John|last=Vinocur|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1983, Bush met with [[President of Romania]] [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]], insisting during the meeting that President Reagan intended to push for arms reductions at the Geneva talks with the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/09/18/Vice-President-George-Bush-met-Sunday-with-President-Nicholae/1371432705600/|title=Vice President George Bush met Sunday with President Nicholae...|first=Cathy|last=Booth|date=September 18, 1983|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, Bush said the US wanted better relations with all countries within the East Bloc though stressed NATO would retaliate in the event of any threatening of European military stability by the Soviets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/09/19/Vice-President-George-Bush-Monday-praised-Communist-Hungarys-human/2242432792000/|title=Vice President George Bush Monday praised Communist Hungary's human...|first=Ruth E.|last=Gruber|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the vice president assailed the Soviet Union for the Berlin Wall and destroying the Korean Air Lines jetliner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/09/21/Vice-President-George-Bush-today-accused-the-Soviet-Union/1835432964800/|title=Vice President George Bush today accused the Soviet Union...|first=Ruth E.|last=Gruber|date=September 21, 1983|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1983 Bush flew to [[El Salvador]] and warned that country's military leaders to end their [[death squads]] and hold fully free elections or face the loss of U.S. aid. "It is not just the President, it is not just me or the Congress. If these death-squad murders continue, you will lose the support of the American people and that would indeed be a tragedy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/12/world/in-salvador-bush-assails-death-squads.html|title=IN SALVADOR, BUSH ASSAILS DEATH SQUADS|first=Lydia|last=Chavez|date=December 12, 1983|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush's aides feared for his safety and thought about calling the meeting off when they discovered apparent blood stains on the floor of the presidential palace of [[Álvaro Magaña]]. Bush was never told of the aides' concerns and a tense meeting was held in which some of Magaña's personnel brandished semiautomatic weapons and refused requests to take them outside.&lt;ref name=nowimp&gt;{{cite web|author=John Solomon |url=http://www.newsweek.com/2011/03/20/a-wimp-he-wasn-t.html |title=A Wimp He Wasn't |work=Newsweek |date=March 20, 2011 |accessdate=May 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush was assigned by Reagan to chair two special task forces, on [[deregulation]] and international drug smuggling. The deregulation task force reviewed hundreds of rules, making specific recommendations on which ones to amend or revise, in order to curb the size of the federal government. The drug smuggling task force coordinated federal efforts to reduce the quantity of drugs entering the United States. Both were popular issues with conservatives, and Bush, largely a moderate, began courting them through his work.&lt;ref name="senate"/&gt;

In January 1984, Bush reported Reagan's stance on Moscow had projected a strong image toward the Soviets as well as heightened the possibility of an arms agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/01/14/Vice-President-George-Bush-said-Saturday-President-Reagans-tough/7010442904400/|title=Vice President George Bush said Saturday President Reagan's tough...|date=January 14, 1984|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 10, 1984, President Reagan designated Bush to lead the American delegation to the funeral of [[Yuri V. Andropov]] and convey America's "hope for an improved dialogue and cooperation which can lead to a more constructive relationship between our two countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/11/world/reagan-names-bush-to-head-delegation-to-moscow.html|title=REAGAN NAMES BUSH TO HEAD DELEGATION TO MOSCOW|first=Francis X|last=Clines|date=February 11, 1984|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On February 24, Bush spoke on the progress made in [[Grenada]] as a result of the Reagan administration coming into play following Vietnam, Watergate, and the presidency of [[Jimmy Carter]] while talking to the American Soybean Association: "When the president faced this crisis in Grenada he didn't wait until we were taken hostage, he acted before the crisis became a humiliation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/02/24/Vice-President-George-Bush-defended-President-Reagans-leadership-Friday/7311446446800/|title=Vice President George Bush defended President Reagan's leadership Friday,...|date=February 24, 1984|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 14, 1984, Bush cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate in favor of 10-warhead MX missile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/06/14/Vice-President-George-Bush-cast-a-dramatic-tie-breaking-vote/3222456033600/|title=Vice President George Bush cast a dramatic, tie-breaking vote...|first=Eliot|last=Brenner|date=June 14, 1984|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1984, Bush said President Reagan likely would state his responsibility for the failure to protect the [[Beirut]] American embassy from bombing but stressed the difficulty of pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/09/30/Vice-President-George-Bush-said-Sunday-President-Reagan-probably/3015465364800/|title=Vice President George Bush said Sunday President Reagan 'probably'...|first=David|last=Lawsky|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second term, 1985–1989===
Reagan and Bush [[United States presidential election, 1984|ran for reelection in 1984]]. The [[Democratic party (United States)|Democratic]] opponent, [[Walter Mondale]], made history by choosing a woman, New York Representative [[Geraldine Ferraro]], as his running mate. She and Bush squared off in [[1984 Vice Presidential Debate|a single televised vice presidential debate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/showdebate.php?debateid=27|title=Bush-Ferraro Vice-Presidential Debate|date=October 11, 1984|accessdate=April 3, 2008|publisher=The American Presidency Project|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080617164446/http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/showdebate.php?debateid=27 |archivedate = June 17, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferraro served as a contrast to the Ivy-League educated Bush; she represented a "[[blue-collar]]" district in [[Queens]], New York. This distinction and her popularity among female journalists left Bush at a disadvantage. Regardless, the Reagan-Bush ticket won in a landslide against the Mondale-Ferraro ticket. Early into his second term as vice president, Bush and his aides were planning a run for the presidency in 1988. By the end of 1985, a committee had been established and over two million dollars was raised for Bush.&lt;ref name="senate"/&gt;

In mid-March 1985, Bush attended the funeral of [[Konstantin Chernenko]], telling reporters in [[Geneva, Switzerland]] that he had "brought a message with me to Moscow from President Reagan. It is a message of peace."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1985/03/12/Bush-arrives-with-message-from-Reagan/6060974431305/|title=Bush arrives with message from Reagan|first=Louise|last=Branson|date=March 12, 1985|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this trip, Bush pledged the US would proceed with a planned military pullout from Grenada during a rally,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1985/03/14/Vice-President-George-Bush-said-Thursday-the-United-States/2955479624400/|title=Vice President George Bush said Thursday the United States...|first=Helen J.|last=Simon|publisher=UPI|date=March 14, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; met with [[President of Nicaragua]] [[Daniel Ortega]] for discussions on the four-point plan for peace of the Sandinista government in [[Brazil]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1985/03/15/Bush-meets-with-Nicaraguan-president/8562479710800/|title=Bush meets with Nicaraguan president|date=March 15, 1985|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stated America would be committed in combatting the Sandinista regime within Nicaragua during an address in Honduras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1985/03/16/Vice-President-George-Bush-told-Honduran-officials-Saturday-that/2031479797200/|title=Vice President George Bush told Honduran officials Saturday that...|first=Dianne|last=Klein|publisher=UPI|date=March 16, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 13, 1985, Bush became the first vice president to serve as [[Acting President of the United States|acting president]] when Reagan underwent surgery to remove [[polyp (medicine)|polyps]] from his [[colon (anatomy)|colon]]; Bush served as the acting president for approximately eight hours.

In October 1985, Bush toured [[Pearl Harbor]] while he received a briefing on Pacific Fleet operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1985/10/11/Vice-President-George-Bush-toured-Pearl-Harbor-and-was/7035497851200/|title=Vice President George Bush toured Pearl Harbor and was...|date=October 11, 1985|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; He told reporters of an improvement in Sino-American relations and disclosed Taiwan as a major topic in his discussions with Chinese officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1985/10/15/Vice-President-George-Bush-said-Tuesday-he-saw-a/5379498196800/|date=October 15, 1985|title=Vice President George Bush said Tuesday he saw a...|first=Ron|last=Redmond|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, the Reagan administration was shaken by a scandal when it was revealed that administration officials had secretly arranged weapon sales to Iran. The officials had used the proceeds to fund the anti-communist [[Contras]] in Nicaragua, which was a direct violation of law. The scandal became known as the [[Iran-Contra Affair]]. When news of the public embarrassment broke to the media, Bush, like Reagan, stated that he had been "out of the loop" and unaware of the diversion of funds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/06/29/reviews/iran-transcript.html|title=Transcript|work=The New York Times|date=June 30, 1997|accessdate=April 2, 2008|format=fee required}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this was later questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB210/index.htm|title=The Iran-Contra Affair 20 Years On|date=November 20, 2006|accessdate=April 3, 2008|publisher=George Washington University}}&lt;/ref&gt; His diaries from that time stated "I'm one of the few people that know fully the details" and as a result of six pardons by Bush, the independent counsel's final report on the [[Iran-Contra Affair]] pointedly noted: "The criminal investigation of Bush was regrettably incomplete."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB210/index.htm |title=The Iran-Contra Affair 20 Years On |publisher=Gwu.edu |accessdate=January 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1986, Bush outlined the government's policy on the combating of terrorism. In an interagency task force report presented to President Reagan, Bush publicly stated that the strategy of the federal government was to retaliate without "wantonly" terminating human lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/07/world/bush-issuing-terror-report-affirms-current-us-policies.html|title=BUSH, ISSUING TERROR REPORT, AFFIRMS CURRENT U.S. POLICIES|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 7, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early April 1986, Bush was hoping to preserve peace when he traveled to the [[Persian Gulf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1986/04/04/Vice-President-George-Bush-en-route-to-the-Persian/9201512974800/|title=Vice President George Bush, en route to the Persian...|publisher=UPI|date=April 4, 1986|first=Norman D.|last=Sandler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May, Bush underwent a procedure to remove a malignant growth from his left cheek. His spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that doctors had found the growth weeks earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/18/us/bush-has-malignancy-removed-from-cheek.html|title=Bush Has Malignancy Removed From Cheek|date=May 18, 1986|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During an appearance at a conference in January 1987, Bush confirmed the torture and subsequent murder of [[William Francis Buckley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/01/21/Vice-President-George-Bush-has-confirmed-that-William-Buckley/2215538203600/|title=Vice President George Bush has confirmed that William Buckley,...|date=January 21, 1987|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1987, Bush addressed the National Religious Broadcasters, warning the group that intolerance was unacceptable and particularly called for racial tolerance. "We must let our children know hatred has no place in America. The Ku Klux Klan is an embarrassment to Christ, whose gospel is love, and an embarrassment to our nation, whose gospel is freedom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/02/02/Vice-President-George-Bush-congratulated-the-nations-religious-broadcasters/6744539240400/|title=Vice President George Bush congratulated the nation's religious broadcasters...|date=February 2, 1987|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1987, Bush announced the resignation of advisor Fred Khedouri as well as implementation of Charles Greenleaf in the same role,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/03/03/Vice-President-George-Bush-announced-the-resignation-of-a/3508541746000/|title=Vice President George Bush announced the resignation of a...|date=March 3, 1987|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; and visited a drug rehabilitation center during a two-day swing through Florida, expressing the view that education was the sole means of ending drug issues throughout the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/03/17/Vice-President-George-Bush-told-parents-and-students-today/4115542955600/|title=Vice President George Bush told parents and students today...|first=Bill|last=Wood|date=March 17, 1987|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1987, Bush embarked on a month long trip to [[Poland]] and European allied countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/08/18/Vice-President-George-Bush-announced-Tuesday-he-will-travel/8055556257600/?spt=su|title=Vice President George Bush announced Tuesday he will travel...|date=August 18, 1987|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 22, Bush cast a tie breaking vote in the Senate to save the Strategic Defense Initiative from receiving a 800 million cut in funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/09/22/Vice-President-George-Bush-cast-a-rare-tie-breaking-vote/6250559281600/|title=Vice President George Bush cast a rare tie-breaking vote...|date=September 22, 1987|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 25, Bush reemployed [[Peter Teeley]] as Director of Communications for his office and presidential campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/09/25/Bush-rehires-Teeley-as-press-spokesman/1494559540800/|title=Bush rehires Teeley as press spokesman|date=September 25, 1987|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 28, Bush delivered a televised address pledging that the US would forever be aligned with Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/09/28/Vice-President-George-Bush-engaged-in-an-extraordinary-public/9779559800000/|title=Vice President George Bush engaged in an extraordinary public...|first=Norman D.|last=Sandler|publisher=UPI|date=September 28, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush's campaign director [[Roger Ailes]] and others were concerned that Bush was seen as a "wimp." Bush put that image  to rest when he displayed evident fury during an interview with [[Dan Rather]].&lt;ref name="senate"/&gt;

As vice president, Bush officially opened the [[1987 Pan American Games]] in [[Indianapolis]].

In 1988, the [[guided missile cruiser]] {{USS|Vincennes|CG-49|6}} accidentally shot down [[Iran Air Flight 655]], killing 290 passengers. Bush said that he would "never apologize for the United States of America. Ever. I don't care what the facts are."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/11/08/when-should-a-president-say-hes-sorry/ |title=When should a president say he's sorry?|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=November 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gwbush1988stl.jpg|thumb|[[John Ashcroft]] and Vice President Bush campaign in St. Louis, Missouri, 1988]]

In the January 26, 1987, issue of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]], journalist Robert Ajemian reported in an article entitled "Where Is the Real George Bush?" that one of Bush's friends had urged him to spend several days at [[Camp David]] thinking through his plans for his prospective presidency. Bush responded in exasperation, "Oh, the vision thing."&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news | last =Ajemian | first =Robert | authorlink = | title =Where Is the Real George Bush? | work=Time | date =January 26, 1987 | url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,963342-2,00.html | accessdate = October 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This oft-cited quote became a shorthand for the charge that Bush failed to contemplate or articulate important policy positions in a compelling and coherent manner. The phrase has since become a [[metonym]] for any politician's failure to incorporate a greater vision in a campaign, and has often been applied in the media to other politicians or public figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joseph-a-palermo/meg-whitmans-vision-thing_b_300845.html|title=Meg Whitman's "Vision Thing"|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/sep/29/gordon-brown-speech-labour-conference|title=Gordon Brown's Labour conference speech - live|author=Andrew Sparrow|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1985, Bush had been planning a presidential run; he entered the Republican primary for President of the United States in October 1987.&lt;ref name="senate"/&gt; His challengers for the Republican presidential nomination included U.S. Senator [[Bob Dole]] of [[Kansas]], U.S. Representative [[Jack Kemp]] of New York, former Governor [[Pete DuPont]] of [[Delaware]], and conservative Christian [[televangelist]] [[Pat Robertson]].

Bush was considered the early frontrunner for the nomination, but he came in third in the Iowa caucus, behind winner Dole and runner-up Robertson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE2DC143CF933A25751C0A96E948260|title=Bush and Simon Seen as Hobbled by Iowa's Voting|date=February 10, 1988|accessdate=April 4, 2008|work=The New York Times | first=R. W. | last=Apple Jr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much as Reagan had done in 1980, Bush reorganized his staff and concentrated on the New Hampshire primary.&lt;ref name="senate"/&gt; With Dole ahead in New Hampshire, Bush ran television commercials portraying the senator as a tax raiser;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/minisite.do?content_type=Minisite_Generic&amp;display_order=1&amp;content_type_id=57687&amp;mini_id=57351|title=New Hampshire: Picking a President|publisher=The History Channel|accessdate=April 4, 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080424102704/http://www.history.com/minisite.do?content_type=Minisite_Generic&amp;display_order=1&amp;content_type_id=57687&amp;mini_id=57351 |archivedate = April 24, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; he rebounded to win the state's primary. Following the primary, Bush and Dole had a joint media appearance, when the interviewer asked Dole if he had anything to say to Bush, Dole said, in response to the ads, "yeah, stop lying about my record!" in an angry tone. This is thought to have hurt Dole's campaign to Bush's benefit. Bush continued seeing victory, winning many Southern primaries as well.&lt;ref name="ea"/&gt; Once the multiple-state primaries such as [[Super Tuesday]] began, Bush's organizational strength and fundraising lead were impossible for the other candidates to match, and the nomination was his.&lt;ref name="msn"/&gt;

As the [[1988 Republican National Convention]] approached, there was much speculation who Bush would choose to be his running mate. He selected little-known U.S. Senator [[Dan Quayle]] of [[Indiana]], who was favored by conservatives. Despite Reagan's popularity, Bush trailed Democratic nominee [[Michael Dukakis]], then [[Governor of Massachusetts]], in most polls.&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/news/national/election2000/conventions/past.bushsenior.html|title=1988: George H. W. Bush Gives the 'Speech of his Life'|publisher=NPR|year=2000|accessdate=April 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush was occasionally criticized for his lack of eloquence when compared to Reagan, but he delivered a well-received speech at the 1988 Republican National Convention. Known as the "[[thousand points of light]]" speech, the presentation described Bush's vision of America. He endorsed the [[Pledge of Allegiance]], [[Capital punishment in the United States|capital punishment]], and [[Right to keep and bear arms in the United States|gun rights]], and drew upon his long-standing Christian beliefs to support both [[school prayer|prayer in schools]] and [[United States pro-life movement|opposed abortion]].&lt;ref name="npr"/&gt; The speech at the convention included Bush's famous pledge: "[[Read my lips: no new taxes]]."&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/9/newsid_3655000/3655368.stm|title=1988: Bush wins with 'no new taxes' promise|accessdate=April 4, 2008 | date=November 9, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general election campaign between the two men was described in 2008 as one of the dirtiest in modern times.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; Bush blamed Dukakis for polluting the [[Boston Harbor]] as the [[Massachusetts governor]].&lt;ref name="ea"/&gt; Bush also pointed out that Dukakis was opposed to a law that would require all students to say the [[Pledge of Allegiance]], a topic well covered in Bush's nomination acceptance speech.&lt;ref name="npr"/&gt;

Dukakis's unconditional opposition to capital punishment led to a pointed question being asked during the presidential debates. Moderator [[Bernard Shaw (journalist)|Bernard Shaw]] asked Dukakis if Dukakis would hypothetically support the death penalty if his wife, [[Kitty Dukakis|Kitty]], were raped and murdered.&lt;ref name="kittyd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.debates.org/pages/trans88b.html|title=The Second Bush-Dukakis Presidential Debate|date=October 13, 1988|accessdate=April 4, 2008|publisher=[[Commission on Presidential debates]]|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080406032116/http://www.debates.org/pages/trans88b.html |archivedate = April 6, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dukakis's response of no, as well as a provocative ad about convicted felon [[Willie Horton]], contributed toward Bush's characterization of Dukakis as "soft on crime".&lt;ref name="ea"/&gt;

Bush defeated Dukakis and his running mate, [[Lloyd Bentsen]], in the [[U.S. Electoral College|Electoral College]], by 426 to 111 (Bentsen received one vote from a [[faithless elector]]).&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; In the nationwide popular vote, Bush took 53.4% of the ballots cast while Dukakis received 45.6%.&lt;ref name="ea"/&gt; Bush became the first serving vice president to be elected president since [[Martin Van Buren]] in 1836 as well as the first person to succeed someone from his own party to the presidency via election to the office in his own right since [[Herbert Hoover]] in 1929.&lt;ref name="senate"/&gt;

===Domestic policy===

====Economy====
Early in his term, Bush faced the problem of what to do with leftover [[United States public debt|deficits]] spawned during the Reagan years. At $220&amp;nbsp;billion in 1990, the deficit had tripled since 1980. Bush was dedicated to curbing the deficit, believing that America could not continue to be a leader in the world without doing so. He began an effort to persuade the [[101st United States Congress|Democratic controlled Congress]] to act on the budget; with Republicans believing that the best way was to cut [[government spending]], and Democrats convinced that the only way would be to [[income tax|raise taxes]], Bush faced problems when it came to consensus building.&lt;ref name="msn"/&gt;

In the wake of a struggle with Congress, Bush was forced by the Democratic majority to raise tax revenues; as a result, many Republicans felt betrayed because Bush had promised "no new taxes" in his 1988 campaign. Perceiving a means of revenge, Republican congressmen defeated Bush's proposal, which would enact spending cuts and tax increases that would reduce the deficit by $500&amp;nbsp;billion over five years. Scrambling, Bush accepted the Democrats' demands for higher taxes and more spending, which alienated him from Republicans and gave way to a sharp [[United States Presidential approval rating|decrease in popularity]]. Bush would later say that he wished he had never signed the bill.&lt;ref name="msn"/&gt; Near the end of the [[101st United States Congress|101st Congress]], the president and congressional members reached a compromise on a budget package that increased the marginal tax rate and phased out exemptions for high-income taxpayers. Although he originally demanded a reduction in the [[capital gains tax]], Bush relented on this issue as well. This agreement with the Democratic leadership in Congress proved to be a turning point in the Bush presidency; his popularity among Republicans never fully recovered.&lt;ref name="ea"/&gt;

[[File:Bush I approval rating.png|thumb|left|Bush's approval ratings (red) compared to his disapproval ratings (blue) for his four-year presidency]]
Coming at around the same time as the budget deal, America entered into a mild recession, lasting for six months. Many government programs, such as welfare, increased.&lt;ref name="msn"/&gt; As the unemployment rate edged upward in 1991, Bush signed a bill providing additional benefits for unemployed workers.&lt;ref name="ea"/&gt; The year 1991 was marked by many corporate reorganizations, which laid off a substantial number of workers. Many now unemployed were Republicans and independents, who had believed that their jobs were secure.

By his second year in office, Bush was told by his economic advisors to stop dealing with the economy, as they believed that he had done everything necessary to ensure his reelection. By 1992, interest and inflation rates were the lowest in years, but by midyear the unemployment rate reached 7.8%, the highest since 1984. In September 1992, the [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau]] reported that 14.2% of all Americans [[poverty rate|lived in poverty]].&lt;ref name="ea"/&gt; At a press conference in 1990, Bush told reporters that he found foreign policy more enjoyable.&lt;ref name="msn"/&gt;

==== Education ====
On April 5, 1989, Bush submitted to Congress the Educational Excellence Act of 1989, a seven program education legislative proposal with the intent of achieving "a better-educated America."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bush41library.tamu.edu/archives/public-papers/272|title=Message to the Congress Transmitting Proposed Legislation on Educational Excellence|date=April 5, 1989|publisher=George H.

In the [[1990 State of the Union Address]], Bush revealed his interest in his administration spearheading the increase in American high school graduation rates to 90% along with making American students "first in the world" in the subjects of math and science by 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1990/01/31/Highlights-of-President-Bushs-State-of-the-Union-speech/3977633762000/|title=Highlights of President Bush's State of the Union speech|date=January 31, 2006|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1990/01/31/Bush-urges-deeper-troop-cuts-in-State-of-the-Union/9454633762000/|title=Bush urges deeper troop cuts in State of the Union|first=Norman D.|last=Sandler|date=January 31, 1990|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech in the White House East Room on April 18, 1991, Bush called for both public and private citizens to become involved with education reform: "To those who want to see real improvement in American education, I say there will be no renaissance without revolution. It's time we held our schools, and ourselves, accountable for results."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1991/11/25/Bush-makes-plug-for-troubled-schools/2906250094671/|title=Bush presents education reform package|first=Janet|last=Bass|date=April 19, 1991|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 3, Bush advocated for community participation in reforming the national education system and insisting America 2000 would fail "if we try to do it from Washington itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bush41library.tamu.edu/archives/public-papers/3054|title=Remarks to Education Leaders|quote=So, what we talk about in the America 2000 strategy, you put into action.

Bush concurrently declared he would be involved with a reform of troubled schools and charged the Democrat-controlled Congress with "fighting tooth and nail against our most important reforms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1991/11/25/Bush-makes-plug-for-troubled-schools/2906250094671/|title=Bush makes plug for troubled schools|first=Thomas|last=Ferraro|publisher=UPI|date=November 25, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 23, 1992, Bush signed the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, a resuming of "many programs in the [[Higher Education Act of 1965]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bush41library.tamu.edu/archives/public-papers/4601|title=Statement on Signing the Higher Education Amendments of 1992|publisher=George H.

During a speech to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the [[Apollo 11]] moon landing, Bush announced a vision to complete [[Space Station Freedom|Space Station ''Freedom'']], resume exploration of the [[Moon]] and begin exploration of [[Mars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=17321 |title=George Bush: Remarks on the 20th Anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon Landing |publisher=Presidency.ucsb.edu |date=July 16, 1969 |accessdate=May 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a space station was eventually constructed–work on the [[International Space Station]] began in 1998–other work has been confounded by NASA budgetary issues. In 1998, Bush received the [http://rnasa.org/1998files/winner1998.html Rotary National Award for Space Achievement's National Space Trophy] for his pioneering leadership of the U.S. space program.

During his presidency, Bush signed a number of major bills into law, including the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]]; this was one of the most pro-[[civil rights]] bills in decades. He is also the only president to successfully veto a civil rights act, having vetoed the job-discrimination protection [[Civil Rights Act of 1990]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ann Devroy|Devroy, Ann]].

He also signed the [[Radiation Exposure Compensation Act]] which provides monetary compensation of people who had contracted cancer and a number of other specified diseases as a direct result of their exposure to atmospheric [[nuclear testing]] undertaken by the United States during the [[Cold War]], or their exposure to high levels of [[radon]] while doing [[uranium mining]]. In dealing with the environment, Bush reauthorized the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], requiring cleaner burning fuels. He quarreled with Congress over an eventually signed bill to aid police in capturing criminals, and signed into law a measure to improve the nation's highway system.&lt;ref name="msn"/&gt; Bush signed the [[Immigration Act of 1990]],&lt;ref&gt;"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=WDV40aK1T-sC&amp;pg=PA282&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Encyclopedia of Minorities in American Politics: African Americans and Asian Americans]''".

Bush became a life member of the [[National Rifle Association]] early in 1988 and had campaigned as a "pro-gun" candidate with the NRA's endorsement.&lt;ref name="Feldman2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Feldman|first=Richard|authorlink=|title=Ricochet: Confessions of a Gun Lobbyist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zi5yAwWxa50C|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-13100-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1989, he placed a temporary ban on the import of certain semiautomatic rifles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Guns in American Society: An Encyclopedia of History, Politics, Culture, and the Law |volume=1 |first=Gregg Lee |last=Carter |page=38|publisher= ABC-CLIO|year=2002 |isbn= 978-1-57607-268-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This action cost him endorsement from the NRA in 1992. Bush publicly resigned his life membership in the organization after receiving a form letter from NRA depicting agents of the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms]] as "jack-booted thugs." He called the NRA letter a "vicious slander on good people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Moral controversies in American politics: cases in social regulatory policy |first=Raymond |last=Tatalovich|author2=Byron W.

===Points of Light===
{{Main|Points of Light}}
President Bush devoted attention to voluntary service as a means of solving some of America's most serious social problems. He often used the "[[thousand points of light]]" theme to describe the power of citizens to solve community problems. In his 1989 inaugural address, President Bush said, "I have spoken of a thousand points of light, of all the community organizations that are spread like stars throughout the Nation, doing good."&lt;ref name="President's Report"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Points of Light Movement: The President's Report to the Nation|publisher=Executive Office of the President, 1993|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Points_of_light_movement.html?id=cH8vlwSAjv0C|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four years later, in his report to the nation on The Points of Light Movement, President Bush said, "Points of Light are the soul of America. They are ordinary people who reach beyond themselves to touch the lives of those in need, bringing hope and opportunity, care and friendship. By giving so generously of themselves, these remarkable individuals show us not only what is best in our heritage but what all of us are called to become."&lt;ref name="President's Report" /&gt;

In 1990, the Points of Light Foundation was created as a nonprofit organization in Washington to promote this spirit of [[volunteerism]].&lt;ref name=Perry&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perry|first=Suzanne|title=After Two Tough Years, New Points of Light Charity Emerges|journal=Chronicle of Philanthropy|date=October 15, 2009|url=http://philanthropy.com/article/After-Two-Tough-Years-New/57753/|accessdate=May 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the Points of Light Foundation merged with the [[Hands On Network]] with the goal of strengthening volunteerism, streamlining costs and services and deepening impact.&lt;ref name=Edward&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edward|first=Deborah|title=Getting to Yes: The Points of Light and Hands On Network Merger|journal=RGK Center for Philanthropy and Community Service, the University of Texas at Austin|year=2008|url=http://www.rgkcenter.org/sites/default/files/file/research/gettingtoyes.pdf|accessdate=May 23, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921061145/http://www.rgkcenter.org/sites/default/files/file/research/gettingtoyes.pdf|archivedate=September 21, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Points of Light]], the organization created through this merger, has approximately 250 affiliates in 22 countries and partnerships with thousands of nonprofits and companies dedicated to volunteer service around the world. In 2012, Points of Light mobilized 4 million volunteers in 30 million hours of service worth $635 million.&lt;ref name="Year in Review"&gt;{{cite web|title=Points of Light 2012 Year in Review|url=http://www.pointsoflight.org/sites/default/files/site-content/files/pol_endofyearappeal_5x8_webversion.pdf|publisher=Points of Light|accessdate=May 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 16, 2009, President [[Barack Obama]] held a Presidential Forum on Service hosted by former President George H. W. Bush and Points of Light at the [[George Bush Presidential Library]] Center on the campus of [[Texas A&amp;M University]]. The event celebrated the contributions of more than 4,500 Daily Point of Light award winners and honored President Bush's legacy of service and civic engagement.&lt;ref name="Presidential Forum"&gt;{{cite news|title=President Obama to Hold Presidential Forum on Service Hosted by former President George H.W.

===Daily Point of Light Award===
President Bush created the Daily Point of Light Award in 1989 to recognize ordinary Americans from all walks of life taking direct and consequential voluntary action in their communities to solve serious social problems. The President focused great attention on these individuals and organizations, both to honor them for their tremendous work and to call the nation to join them and multiply their efforts. By the end of his administration, President Bush had recognized 1,020 Daily Points of Light representing all 50 states and addressing issues ranging from care for infants and teenagers with AIDS to adult illiteracy and from gang violence to job training for the [[homeless]].&lt;ref name="President's Report" /&gt; The Daily Point of Light continues to be awarded by Points of Light and President Bush continues to sign all of the awards.&lt;ref name=Leader-Telegram&gt;{{cite news|title=Health Matters 07/10/13|url=http://www.leadertelegram.com/features/health/article_59336b2a-6092-5baa-b8c0-dab07e3ea301.html|accessdate=July 11, 2013|newspaper=Leader-Telegram|date=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 15, 2013, President [[Barack Obama]] welcomed President Bush to the White House to celebrate the 5,000th Daily Point of Light Award.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|last=Landler|first=Mark|title=At White House Homecoming, Elder Bush's 'Points of Light' Shine On|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/16/us/politics/at-white-house-elder-bush-pays-tribute-and-receives-it.html?_r=0|accessdate=July 18, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They bestowed the award on Floyd Hammer and Kathy Hamilton of [[Union, Iowa]], for their work founding Outreach, a nonprofit that delivers free meals to hungry children in 15 countries.&lt;ref name="Washington Post - 5000th DPOL"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rucker|first=Philip|title=Obama pays tribute to George H.W.

====Other courts====
{{Main|List of federal judges appointed by George H. W. Bush}}

In addition to his two [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] appointments, Bush appointed 42 judges to the [[United States Courts of Appeals]], and 148 judges to the [[United States district court]]s. Among these appointments was [[Vaughn R. Walker]], who would later be revealed to be the earliest known gay federal judge.&lt;ref name=reuters_20110406&gt;{{cite news|first=Dan|last=Levine|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/06/us-gaymarriage-judge-idUSTRE7356TA20110406|agency=Reuters |title=Gay judge never considered dropping Prop 8 case|accessdate=April 6, 2011|date=April 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush also experienced a number of [[George H.

====Panama====
{{Main|United States invasion of Panama}}
In the 1980s, Panamanian leader [[Manuel Noriega]], a once U.S.-supportive leader who was later accused of spying for [[Fidel Castro]] and using Panama to traffic drugs into the United States, was one of the most recognizable names in America and was constantly in the press. The struggle to remove him from power began in the Reagan administration, when economic sanctions were imposed on the country; this included prohibiting American companies and government from making payments to Panama and freezing $56&amp;nbsp;million in Panamanian funds in American banks. Reagan sent more than 2,000 American troops to Panama as well.&lt;ref name="rutgers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~hbf/panama.htm|title=Panama: Background and Buildup to Invasion of 1989|accessdate=April 11, 2008|author=Franklin, Jane|year=2001|publisher=Rutgers University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Reagan, Bush was able to remove Noriega from power, but his administration's unsuccessful post-invasion planning hindered the needs of Panama during the establishment of the young democratic government.&lt;ref name="texas"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prudence in Panama: George H.

In May 1989, Panama held democratic elections, in which [[Guillermo Endara]] was elected president; the results were then annulled by Noriega's government. In response, Bush sent 2,000 more troops to the country, where they began conducting regular military exercises in Panamanian territory (in violation of prior treaties). Bush then removed an embassy and [[United States ambassador|ambassador]] from the country, and dispatched additional troops to Panama to prepare the way for an upcoming invasion.&lt;ref name="rutgers"/&gt; Noriega suppressed an October [[military coup]] attempt and massive protests in Panama against him, but after a U.S. serviceman was shot by Panamanian forces in December 1989, Bush ordered 24,000 troops into the country with an objective of removing Noriega from power;&lt;ref name="secdef"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defenselink.mil/specials/secdef_histories/bios/cheney.htm|title=Richard B.

====Soviet Union====

[[File:Bush Gorba P15623-25A.jpg|thumb|Bush and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in Helsinki summit in 1990]]

In 1989, just after the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]], Bush met with [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet General Secretary]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in [[Malta Summit|a conference]] on the Mediterranean island of [[Malta]]. The administration had been under intense pressure to meet with the Soviets, but not all initially found the [[Malta Summit]] to be a step in the right direction; General [[Brent Scowcroft]], among others, was apprehensive about the meeting, saying that it might be "premature" due to concerns where, according to [[Condoleezza Rice]], "expectations [would be] set that something was going to happen, where the Soviets might grandstand and force [the U.S.] into agreements that would ultimately not be good for the United States." But European leaders, including [[François Mitterrand]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]], encouraged Bush to meet with Gorbachev,&lt;ref name="dr rice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/coldwar/interviews/episode-24/rice1.html|publisher=George Washington University|accessdate=April 11, 2008|title=Interview with Dr. Condoleezza Rice|date=December 17, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; something that he did December 2 and 3, 1989.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Malta Summit]] for more information&lt;/ref&gt; Though no agreements were signed, the meeting was viewed largely as being an important one; when asked about nuclear war, Gorbachev responded, "I assured the President of the United States that the Soviet Union would never start a hot war against the United States of America. And we would like our relations to develop in such a way that they would open greater possibilities for cooperation.... This is just the beginning. We are just at the very beginning of our road, long road to a long-lasting, peaceful period."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE1D7173FF937A35751C1A96F948260|title=The Malta Summit; Transcript of the Bush-Gorbachev News Conference in Malta|agency=Associated Press|work=The New York Times|accessdate=April 11, 2008|date=December 4, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting was received as a very important step to the end of the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/3/newsid_4119000/4119950.stm|title=1989: Malta summit ends Cold War|accessdate=April 11, 2008|date=December 3, 1989|publisher=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another summit was held in July 1991, where the [[START I|Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START I)]] was signed by Bush and Gorbachev in Moscow. The treaty took nine years in the making and was the first major arms agreement since the signing of the [[INF Treaty|Intermediate Ranged Nuclear Forces Treaty]] by Reagan and Gorbachev in 1987. The contentions in START would reduce the strategic nuclear weapons of the United States and the USSR by about 35% over seven years, and the Soviet Union's land-based [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s would be cut by 50%. Bush described START as "a significant step forward in dispelling half a century of mistrust".&lt;ref name="bbc moscow"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/31/newsid_4582000/4582773.stm|date=July 31, 1991|accessdate=April 11, 2008|publisher=BBC News |title=1991: Superpowers to cut nuclear warheads}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)#Dissolution of the USSR|dissolution of the USSR]] in 1991, President Bush and Gorbachev declared a U.S.-Russian strategic partnership, marking the end of the [[Cold War]].

====Gulf War====
{{Main|Gulf War}}
[[File:Bush troops.jpg|thumb|President Bush visits American troops in Saudi Arabia on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]], 1990]]
On August 2, 1990, Iraq, led by [[Saddam Hussein]], invaded its oil-rich neighbor to the south, [[Kuwait]]; Bush condemned the invasion&lt;ref name="pbs-gulfwar"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/gulf/cron/|title=The Gulf War: A Chronology|accessdate=April 11, 2008|publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began rallying opposition to Iraq in the US and among European, Asian, and Middle Eastern allies.&lt;ref name="msn"/&gt; [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Dick Cheney|Richard Bruce "Dick" Cheney]] traveled to Saudi Arabia to meet with [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|King Fahd]]; Fahd requested US military aid in the matter, fearing a possible invasion of his country as well.&lt;ref name="pbs-gulfwar"/&gt; The request was met initially with [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] fighter jets. Iraq made attempts to negotiate a deal that would allow the country to take control of half of Kuwait. Bush rejected this proposal and insisted on a complete withdrawal of Iraqi forces.&lt;ref name="msn"/&gt; The planning of a ground operation by US-led coalition forces began forming in September 1990, headed by General [[Norman Schwarzkopf]].&lt;ref name="pbs-gulfwar"/&gt; Bush spoke before a joint session of the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] regarding the authorization of air and land attacks, laying out four immediate objectives: "Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait completely, immediately, and without condition. Kuwait's legitimate government must be restored. The security and stability of the Persian Gulf must be assured. And American citizens abroad must be protected." He then outlined a fifth, long-term objective: "Out of these troubled times, our fifth objective – a new world order – can emerge: a new era – freer from the threat of terror, stronger in the pursuit of justice, and more secure in the quest for peace. An era in which the nations of the world, East and West, North and South, can prosper and live in harmony.... A world where the rule of law supplants the rule of the jungle. A world in which nations recognize the shared responsibility for freedom and justice. A world where the strong respect the rights of the weak."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bush41library.tamu.edu/archives/public-papers/2217|title=George H. W.

Early on the morning of January 17, 1991, allied forces launched the first attack, which included more than 4,000 bombing runs by coalition aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bush41library.tamu.edu/archives/public-papers/2625 Address to the Nation Announcing Allied Military Action in the Persian Gulf (January 16, 1991)]&lt;/ref&gt; This pace would continue for the next four weeks, until a ground invasion was launched on February 24, 1991. Allied forces penetrated Iraqi lines and pushed toward [[Kuwait City]] while on the west side of the country, forces were intercepting the retreating Iraqi army. Bush made the decision to stop the offensive after a mere 100 hours.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bush41library.tamu.edu/archives/public-papers/2746 Address to the Nation on the Suspension of Allied Offensive Combat Operations in the Persian Gulf (February 27, 1991)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0227.html#article|title=Bush Halts Offensive Combat; Kuwait Freed, Iraqis Crushed|date=February 28, 1991|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics labeled this decision premature, as hundreds of Iraqi forces were able to escape; Bush responded by saying that he wanted to minimize U.S. casualties. Opponents further charged that Bush should have continued the attack, pushing Hussein's army back to Baghdad, then removing him from power.&lt;ref name="msn"/&gt; Bush explained that he did not give the order to overthrow the Iraqi government because it would have "incurred incalculable human and political costs.... We would have been forced to occupy Baghdad and, in effect, rule Iraq."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/politics/quotes/gulfwar.asp|title=A World Transformed|year=2003|accessdate=April 11, 2008|publisher=Snopes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush's approval ratings skyrocketed after the successful offensive.&lt;ref name="msn"/&gt; Additionally, President Bush and Secretary of State Baker felt the coalition victory had increased U.S. prestige abroad and believed there was a window of opportunity to use the political capital generated by the coalition victory to revitalize the Arab-Israeli peace process. The administration immediately returned to Arab-Israeli peacemaking following the end of the Gulf War; this resulted in the [[Madrid Conference]], later in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Middle East Review of International Affairs Journal Volume 6, No. 1 – March 2002 [http://www.rubincenter.org/2002/03/lasensky-2002-03-07/ Underwriting Peace in the Middle East: U.S. Foreign Policy and the Limits of Economic Inducements]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Somali Civil War====
{{Main|Somali Civil War}}
Faced with a humanitarian disaster in [[Somalia]] that was exacerbated by a complete breakdown in civil order, the United Nations had created the [[UNOSOM I]] mission in April 1992 to aid the situation through humanitarian efforts, though the mission failed.&lt;ref name=UNDP&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Depts/DPKO/Missions/unosomi.htm |title=UNITED NATIONS OPERATION IN SOMALIA I, UN Dept of Peacekeeping|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=May 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bush administration proposed American aid to the region by assisting in creating a secure environment for humanitarian efforts and UN Resolution 794 was unanimously adopted by the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] on December 3, 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Security Council Resolution 794&lt;/ref&gt; A [[lame duck (politics)|lame duck]] president, Bush launched [[Operation Restore Hope]] the following day under which the United States would assume command in accordance with Resolution 794.&lt;ref&gt;Bush, George H., Address to the Nation on the Situation in Somalia, 4/12/92&lt;/ref&gt; Fighting would escalate and continue into the Clinton administration.&lt;ref name=Atkinson94&gt;{{cite journal |journal =[[The Washington Post]] ''(online, January 31)'' |author=Atkinson, Rick| date= 1994 | title = Night of a Thousand Casualties | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1994/01/31/night-of-a-thousand-casualties/1f0c97b1-1605-46e5-9466-ba3599120c25/ | access-date=November 4, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Japan ====
During an April 28, 1989 appearance in the press room of the White House, Bush announced that the U.S. would continue a deal with Japan to produce the FSX advanced fighter jet. He said that promises had been made that American jobs and technology would be safe and the proposal would bolster security for both the U.S. and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-04-30/news/mn-2867_1_fsx-japan-s-ambassador-nobuo-matsunaga-japan-s-mitsubishi-heavy-industries|title=Bush Clears Way for FSX Fighter Deal With Japan|date=April 30, 1989|publisher=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 21, 1989, Bush signed a measure that guaranteed reparations to Japanese-Americans who were relocated into [[Internment of Japanese Americans|internment camps]] during [[World War II]]. Congress authorized US$20,000 for each survivor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-11-22/news/mn-164_1_bush-signs|title=Bush Signs Japanese-American Reparation Guarantee|date=November 22, 1989|publisher=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 12, 1990, Bush met for an hour with former [[Prime Minister of Japan]] [[Noboru Takeshita]] to discuss shared economic issues and "the fact that their solution will require extraordinary efforts on both sides of the Pacific."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1990/03/12/Former-Japanese-Prime-Minister-Meets-Bush/7513637218000/|title=Former Japanese Prime Minister Meets Bush|first=Norman D.|last=Sandler|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 6, 1991, Japanese Prime Minister [[Kiichi Miyazawa]] apologized to the United States for the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. The following day—which was the fiftieth anniversary of the attack—Bush accepted Japan's apology for the attack that drew the United States into World War II. Bush urged that progress be made in improving relations between the U.S. and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1991/12/07/Bush-says-US-appreciates-remorse-of-Japan/6434692082000/|title=Bush says U.S. appreciates 'remorse' of Japan|publisher=UPI|date=December 7, 1991|first=Thomas|last=Ferraro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Israel ====
On June 18, 1990, [[White House Press Secretary]] [[Marlin Fitzwater]] confirmed President Bush had sent [[Prime Minister of Israel]] [[Yitzhak Shamir]] a letter in which he congratulated the latter on his election and urged him to support the proposed "Shamir initiative for peace", which would involve the participation of Palestinian Arabians in local elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1990/06/18/Bush-congratulates-Shamir-pushes-peace-process/4351645681600/|title=Bush congratulates Shamir, pushes peace process|publisher=UPI|date=June 18, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 20, Bush suspended American dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization for the latter's refusal to condemn the Palestinian guerrilla raid of an Israeli beach the previous month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-06-21/news/mn-118_1_splinter-group|title=Bush Suspends Talks With PLO : Terrorism: President assails the organization's failure to denounce a splinter group's raid on an Israeli beach.|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=June 21, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 11, 1992, following a meeting between President Bush and Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]], Bush announced he would seek the approval of Congress to bestow Israel up to $10 billion in loan guarantees to assist the country with its absorbing of Soviet Union immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1992/08/12/Bush-strikes-Israel-loan-deal-with-Rabin/3144713592000/|title=Bush strikes Irael loan deal with Rabin|first=Steven|last=Heilbronner|publisher=UPI|date=August 12, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bush41library.tamu.edu/archives/public-papers/4655|title=The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel in Kennebunkport|date=August 11, 1992|quote=Literally hundreds of thousands of Jews from Ethiopia and from the former Soviet Union now make their homes in Israel; and this, more than anything else, is what the Jewish state is all about.

We can thus pursue these two humanitarian goals at one and the same time.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NAFTA===
{{Main|North American Free Trade Agreement}}
[[File:Nafta.jpg|thumb|Standing: President [[Carlos Salinas]], President Bush, Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]]; Seated: [[Jaime Serra Puche]], [[Carla Hills]], and [[Michael Wilson (Canadian politician)|Michael Wilson]] at the NAFTA Initialing Ceremony, October 1992]]
The Bush administration and the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] [[Canadian Prime Minister]] [[Brian Mulroney]] spearheaded the negotiations of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA). The agreement would eliminate the majority of [[tariff]]s on products that were traded among the United States, Canada, and Mexico. This would encourage trade among the countries. The treaty also restricted patents, copyrights, and trademarks, and outlined the removal of investment restrictions among the three countries.&lt;ref name="fedex"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fedex.com/us/customersupport/ftn/faq/nafta.html?link=4 |publisher=Federal Express|title=Frequently Asked Questions: NAFTA|accessdate=April 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Bush announced the completion of NAFTA during a Rose Garden appearance on August 12, 1992, calling it the "beginning of a new era".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1992/08/12/Bush-announces-new-trade-pact-with-Mexico/2321509303014/|title=Bush announces new trade pact with Mexico|first=Helen|last=Thomas|publisher=UPI|date=August 12, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agreement came under heavy scrutiny amongst mainly Democrats, who charged that NAFTA resulted in a loss of American jobs.&lt;ref name="msn"/&gt; NAFTA also contained no provisions for labor rights; according to the Bush administration, the trade agreement would generate economic resources necessary to enable Mexico's government to overcome problems of funding and enforcement of its labor laws. Bush needed a renewal of negotiating authority to move forward with the NAFTA trade talks. Such authority would enable the president to negotiate a trade accord that would be submitted to Congress for a vote, thereby avoiding a situation in which the president would be required to renegotiate with trading partners those parts of an agreement that Congress wished to change.&lt;ref name="nafta labor"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/nafta/nafta0401-04.htm|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=April 11, 2008|title= The NAFTA Labor Side Accord}}&lt;/ref&gt; While initial signing was possible during his term, negotiations made slow, but steady, progress. President Clinton would go on to make the passage of NAFTA a priority for his administration, despite its conservative and Republican roots—with the addition of two side agreements—to achieve its passage in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.law.duke.edu/lib/researchguides/nafta.html|title=NAFTA|publisher=Duke University|accessdate=July 30, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420094150/http://www.law.duke.edu/lib/researchguides/nafta.html |archive-date=April 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The treaty has since been defended as well as criticized further. The American economy has grown 54% since the adoption of NAFTA in 1993, with 25&amp;nbsp;million new jobs created; this was seen by some as evidence of NAFTA being beneficial to the United States.&lt;ref name="wapo-nafta"&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/29/AR2008022902608.html | title= Stop Hating on NAFTA|work=The Washington Post|author=Gutierrez, Carlos M|date= March 1, 2008 | accessdate =April 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; With talk in early 2008 regarding a possible American withdrawal from the treaty, [[Carlos M.

===Pardons===
{{Main|List of people pardoned by George H. W. Bush}}
In keeping with tradition, Bush issued a series of pardons during his last days in office. On December 24, 1992, he granted executive clemency to six former government employees implicated in the Iran-Contra scandal of the late 1980s, most prominently former Secretary of Defense [[Caspar Weinberger]].&lt;ref name="scientists"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/news/iran/1992/921224-260039.htm |title=Bush pardons Weinberger, Five Other Tied to Iran-Contra |accessdate=April 11, 2008 |publisher=Federation of American Scientists |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421150512/http://www.fas.org/news/iran/1992/921224-260039.htm |archivedate=April 21, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush described Weinberger, who was scheduled to stand trial on January 5, 1993, for criminal charges related to Iran-Contra, as a "true American patriot".&lt;ref name="scientists"/&gt;

In addition to Weinberger, Bush pardoned Duane R. Clarridge, Clair E. George, [[Robert C. McFarlane]], [[Elliott Abrams]], and Alan G. Fiers Jr., all of whom had been indicted and/or convicted of criminal charges by an [[United States Office of the Independent Counsel|Independent Counsel]] headed by Lawrence Walsh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/pardon/bushgrants.htm|title=Pardons and Commutations Granted by President George H.

===Awards and honors===
In 1990, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]] ''magazine named him the [[Time Man of the Year|Man of the Year]]. In 1991, the U.S. Navy Memorial Foundation awarded Bush its Lone Sailor award for his naval service and his subsequent government service. In 1993, he was made an Honorary [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath]] by Queen Elizabeth II.&lt;ref name="Honours: Order of the Bath"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page4883.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530062826/http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page4883.asp|archivedate=May 30, 2008|title=Honours: Order of the Bath|publisher=The British Monarchy Today|accessdate=March 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, he received the [[PGA Tour Lifetime Achievement Award]].

===1992 presidential campaign===
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1992}}
In early 1992, Bush announced that he would seek a second term. A coalition victory in the Persian Gulf War and high approval ratings made re-election seem likely. As a result, many leading Democrats declined to seek their party's presidential nomination. On the negative side, Bush's popularity was reduced by an economic recession and doubts of whether he properly ended the Gulf War.

Conservative political columnist [[Pat Buchanan]] challenged Bush for the Republican nomination. He shocked political pundits by finishing second, with 37% of the vote in the New Hampshire primary. Bush responded by adopting more conservative positions on issues, in an attempt to undermine Buchanan's base.&lt;ref name="msn"/&gt; Once he had secured the nomination, Bush faced his Democratic challenger, [[Governor of Arkansas|Arkansas Governor]] [[Bill Clinton]]. Clinton attacked Bush as a politician who was not doing enough to assist the working middle-class and being "out of touch" with the common man, a notion reinforced by reporter [[Andrew Rosenthal]]'s false report that Bush was "astonished" to see a demonstration of a supermarket [[barcode reader|scanner]].&lt;ref name=Goldberg08/&gt;&lt;ref name="snopes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/history/american/bushscan.htm |title=Maybe I'm Amazed |date=April 1, 2001 |accessdate=April 11, 2008 |publisher=Snopes.com |archivedate=May 27, 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120527030747/http://www.snopes.com/history/american/bushscan.asp |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosenthal92/&gt;

[[File:ElectoralCollege1992.svg|upright=1.35|thumb|The 1992 presidential electoral votes by state]]
In early 1992, the race took an unexpected twist when Texas billionaire [[H. Ross Perot]] launched a third party bid, claiming that neither Republicans nor Democrats could eliminate the deficit and make government more efficient. His message appealed to voters across the political spectrum disappointed with both parties' perceived fiscal irresponsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Perot Vote|publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard College|accessdate=April 23, 2008|url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/case/3pt/perot_vote.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perot later bowed out of the race for a short time, then reentered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEED71331F934A15753C1A964958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|title=The 1992 Campaign: The Independent; Bush Aide calls Perot's story 'paranoid'|date=October 27, 1992|accessdate=April 14, 2008|work=The New York Times|author=Holmes, Steven A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinton had originally been in the lead, until Perot reentered, tightening the race significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE5DC1E3AF936A15753C1A964958260|title=The 1992 Campaign: The Overview; Contest tightens as Perot Resurges and Clinton slips|accessdate=April 14, 2008|date=October 25, 1992|work=The New York Times|author=Toner, Robin}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Election Day neared, the polls suggested that the race was a dead-heat,&lt;ref name="ea"/&gt; but Clinton pulled out on top, with 370 electoral votes to Bush's 168 votes.

Several key factors led to Bush's defeat. The ailing economy that arose from recession may have been the main factor in Bush's loss. On Election Day,  7 in 10 voters said that the economy was either "not so good" or "poor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=R. W.

Conservative Republicans pointed out that Bush's 1990 agreement to raise taxes contradicted his famous "[[Read my lips: no new taxes]]" pledge. In doing so, Bush alienated many members of his conservative base, losing their support for his re-election. According to one survey, of the voters who cited Bush's broken "No New Taxes" pledge as "very important", two thirds voted for Bill Clinton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jeffrey |last=Schmalz |title=Clinton Carves a Path Deep Into Reagan Country |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEFD8173FF937A35752C1A964958260&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Clinton+Carves+a+Wide+Path+Deep+Into+Reagan+Country&amp;st=nyt |work=The New York Times |date=November 4, 1992 |accessdate=May 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush had raised taxes in an attempt to address an increasing budget deficit, which has largely been attributed to the Reagan tax cuts and military spending of the 1980s. The tax revenue increase had not hurt his approval ratings to the extent that it prevented it from reaching 89% during the [[Gulf War]], four months after the tax vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tnr.com/blog/plank/110499/the-illusory-power-grover-norquist The Illusory Power of Grover Norquist]|     Timothy Noah| November 27, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; By February 1991 his approval rating rose to its highest level—89%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallup.com/poll/116677/presidential-approval-ratings-gallup-historical-statistics-trends.aspx Presidential Approval Ratings – Gallup Historical Statistics and Trends] Gallup.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Bush became the first elected Republican president since Hoover in [[United States presidential election, 1932|1932]] to lose a reelection bid (facing a 34% approval rating leading up to the 1992 election), the mood did not last. Despite his defeat, Bush climbed back from election day approval levels to leave office in 1993 with a 56% job approval rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/sections/politics/DailyNews/poll%5Fclintonlegacy010117.html|title=Poll: Clinton Legacy Mixed|author=Langer, Gary|publisher=ABC News|date=January 17, 2001|accessdate=April 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; By December 2008, 60% of Americans gave Bush's presidency a positive rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Paul Steinhauser|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/01/07/polls.former.presidents/index.html#cnnSTCText |title=CNN, Views soften on 2 former presidents, CNN poll finds |publisher=CNN |accessdate=September 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Bush was awarded an honorary [[knighthood]] ([[Order of the Bath|GCB]]) by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]. He was the third American president to receive the honor, the others being Dwight D. Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan.&lt;ref name="Honours: Order of the Bath"/&gt;

In 1993, Bush was targeted in an assassination plot when he visited Kuwait to commemorate the coalition's victory over Iraq in the Gulf War. Kuwaiti authorities arrested 17 people who were allegedly involved in using a car bomb to kill Bush. Through interviews with the suspects and examinations of the bomb's circuitry and wiring, the FBI established that the plot had been directed by the [[Iraqi Intelligence Service]]. A Kuwaiti court later convicted all but one of the defendants. Two months later, Clinton retaliated when he ordered the [[Cruise missile strikes on Iraq (1993)|firing]] of 23 [[cruise missiles]] at Iraqi Intelligence Service headquarters in [[Baghdad]]. The day before the strike, U.S. Ambassador to the UN [[Madeleine Albright]] went before the Security Council to present evidence of the Iraqi plot. After the missiles were fired, Vice President [[Al Gore]] said the attack "was intended to be a proportionate response at the place where this plot" to assassinate Bush "was hatched and implemented".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/longroad/etc/assassination.html |title=frontline: the long road to war: assassination |publisher=PBS |accessdate=September 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1993, Bush and other living former presidents were invited back to the White House for an Arab-Israeli peace accord. They also made the case to Clinton for a repeal of [[NAFTA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Destiny and Power: The American Odyssey of George Herbert Walker Bush|first=Jon|last=Meacham|page=543|year=2015|isbn=978-1400067657|publisher=Random House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1994 gubernatorial elections, his sons George W. and Jeb concurrently ran for [[Governor of Texas]] and [[Governor of Florida]]. The elder Bush frequently telephoned campaign headquarters for updates on the race.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham, p. 549.&lt;/ref&gt; George W. won his race against [[Ann Richards]] while Jeb lost to [[Lawton Chiles]]. After the results came in, the elder Bush told ABC, "I have very mixed emotions.

On September 28, 1994, Bush said he was opposed to sending American troops to [[Haiti]], citing his loss of confidence in [[President of Haiti]] [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]] while speaking to business and civic leaders in [[Houston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1994/09/28/Bush-has-lost-confidence-in-Aristide/2821780724800/|title=Bush has lost confidence in Aristide|first=Paula|last=Dittrick|date=September 28, 1994|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an October 22, 1994 speech in [[Cancun, Mexico]], Bush said history would vindicate him for not attempting to force Saddam Hussein out of power while in office: "The Mideast peace talks that offer hope to the world would never have started if we had done that.

=== George W. Bush presidency ===
[[File:G &amp; B. Bush F-SD-03-15575.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.9|George and Barbara Bush, 2001]]
His eldest son, [[George W. Bush]], was inaugurated as the 43rd president of the United States on January 20, 2001, and re-elected in 2004. Through previous administrations, the elder Bush had ubiquitously been known as "George Bush" or "President Bush", but following his son's election the need to distinguish between them has made [[retronym]]ic forms such as "George H. W. Bush" and "George Bush senior" and colloquialisms such as "Bush 41" and "Bush the Elder" much more common. H.W. Bush was traveling to [[Minnesota]] for a speaking engagement on the day of the [[September 11 attacks]]. George W. made multiple calls to get in contact with his father before the two men reconnected after the elder Bush had gone to a [[Brookfield, Wisconsin]] motel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=41: A Portrait of My Father|first=George W.|last=Bush|authorlink=George W.

In December 2002, George W. sought counsel from the elder Bush regarding Iraq and informed him of "my efforts to rally the Saudis, Jordanians, Turks, and others in the Middle East".&lt;ref&gt;Meacham, pp. 571-572.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the fall of Baghdad, Bush praised George W. in an  April 2003 email to the incumbent president.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham, p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt; In a September 14, 2003 interview with BBC, Bush stated his support for a continuation of his son's war against terrorism and the US was in a better state in terms of protecting itself from terrorism than two years prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Top_News/2003/09/14/Ex-president-Bush-backs-war-on-terrorism/87711063557337/|title=Ex-president Bush backs war on terrorism|date=September 14, 2003|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; While visiting Houston VA Medical Center on December 17, Bush told reporters of his satisfaction with the capture of Saddam Hussein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Top_News/2003/12/17/Elder-Bush-says-capture-magical-moment/99301071700689/|title=Elder Bush says capture magical moment|publisher=UPI|date=December 17, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009, Bush came out in support for [[Sonia Sotomayor]] to receive fair hearings in her nomination for Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. "She was called by somebody a racist once. That's not right. I mean, that's not fair. It doesn't help the process. You're out there name-calling.

In October 2009, Bush criticized the rampant criticism of the current times, reflecting that he did not receive such "day in and day out" during his presidency and named [[Keith Olbermann]] and [[Rachel Maddow]] of [[MSNBC]] as examples; he called the two "sick puppies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/elder-bush-decries-lack-of-civility-in-politics/|title=Elder Bush Decries Lack of Civility in Politics|date=October 16, 2009|publisher=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also during that month, on October 16, Bush joined President [[Barack Obama]] onstage at [[Texas A&amp;M University]] for a promotion of volunteering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/17/us/politics/17obama.html|title=Two Presidents Share a Stage on the Subject of Service |date=October 16, 2009|first=Peter|last=Baker|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Howard Winchester Hawks''' (May 30, 1896{{spaced ndash}}December 26, 1977) was an American film director, producer and screenwriter of the [[Classical Hollywood cinema|classic Hollywood era]]. Critic [[Leonard Maltin]] called him "the greatest American director who is not a household name."&lt;ref name="Reel Winners" /&gt;

Hawks was a versatile director whose career included comedies, dramas, gangster films, science fiction, [[film noir]], and westerns.&lt;ref name=historyfilm&gt;Wheeler Winston Dixon and Gwendolyn Audrey Foster, ''A Short History of Film'' (New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press) p. 99—101. {{ISBN|978-0-8135-4270-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His most popular films include ''[[Scarface (1932 film)|Scarface]]'' (1932),  ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'' (1938), ''[[Only Angels Have Wings]]'' (1939), ''[[His Girl Friday]]'' (1940), ''[[To Have and Have Not (film)|To Have and Have Not]]'' (1944), ''[[The Big Sleep (1946 film)|The Big Sleep]]'' (1946), ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]'' (1948), ''[[The Thing from Another World]]'' (1951), and ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'' (1959). His frequent portrayals of strong, tough-talking female characters came to define a type—the "[[Hawksian woman]]".&lt;ref name=historyfilm/&gt;

In 1942, Hawks was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Director]] for ''[[Sergeant York (film)|Sergeant York]],'' and in 1975 he was awarded an [[Honorary Academy Award]] as "a master American filmmaker whose creative efforts hold a distinguished place in world cinema."&lt;ref&gt;[https://us.imdb.com/name/nm0001328/awards "Awards."] ''IMDb''. Retrieved: July 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; His work has influenced some of the most popular and respected directors such as [[Martin Scorsese]], [[Robert Altman]], [[John Carpenter]], and [[Quentin Tarantino]].

==Early life and education==

===Family===
Howard Winchester Hawks was born in [[Goshen, Indiana]], the first-born child of Frank Winchester Hawks (1865–1950), a wealthy paper manufacturer, and his wife, Helen Brown (née Howard; 1872–1952), the daughter of a wealthy industrialist. Hawks' family on his father's side were American pioneers and his ancestor John Hawks had emigrated from [[England]] to [[Massachusetts]] in 1630. The family eventually settled in Goshen and by the 1890s was one of the wealthiest families in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], due mostly to the highly profitable Goshen Milling Company.&lt;ref name="McCarthy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCarthy|first1=Todd|title=Howard Hawks: The Grey Fox of Hollywood|date=1997|publisher=Grove Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8021-3740-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VurpbRg7GRoC&amp;pg=PT59}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18–19}}

Hawks' maternal grandfather, C. W. Howard (1845–1916), had homesteaded in [[Neenah, Wisconsin]] in 1862 at age 17. Within 15 years he had made his fortune in the town's [[paper mill]] and other industrial endeavors.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|25}} Frank Hawks and Helen Howard met in the early  1890s and married in 1895. Howard Hawks was the eldest of five children and his birth was followed by [[Kenneth Hawks|Kenneth Neil Hawks]] (August 12, 1899 – January 2, 1930), [[William Hawks|William Bellinger Hawks]] (January 29, 1901 – January 10, 1969), Grace Louise Hawks (October 17, 1903 – December 23, 1927) and Helen Bernice Hawks (1906 – May 4, 1911). In 1898, the family moved to [[Neenah, Wisconsin]] where Frank Hawks began working for his father-in-law's Howard Paper Company.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|27–29}}

===Education===
Between 1906 and 1909, the Hawks family began to spend more time in [[Pasadena, California]] during the cold Wisconsin winters in order to improve Helen Hawks' ill health. Gradually they began to spend only their summers in Wisconsin before permanently moving to Pasadena in 1910.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|31}} The family settled in a house down the street from [[California Institute of Technology|Throop Polytechnic Institute]] (which would eventually become California Institute of Technology), and the Hawks children began attending the school's [[Polytechnic School|Polytechnic Elementary School]] in 1907.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|34–35}}

Hawks was an average student at school and did not excel in sports, but by 1910 had discovered [[Gravity racer|coaster racing]], an early form of soapbox racing. In 1911, Hawks' youngest sibling Helen died suddenly of food poisoning.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|34–36}}&lt;ref name=Wakeman2&gt;{{cite book|title= World Film Directors, Volume 1, 1890–1945|location=New York|publisher=The H.W. Wilson Company|date=1987|last1=Wakeman|first1=John|isbn=978-0-8242-0757-1|pages=446–451}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1910 to 1912, Hawks attended [[Pasadena High School (Pasadena, California)|Pasadena High School]]. But in 1912, the Hawks family moved to nearby [[Glendora, California]], where Frank Hawks owned orange groves. Hawks finished his junior year of high school at Citrus Union High School in Glendora.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|36}}&lt;!--guessing at the page number since I can't find it in the Google book scan--&gt; During this time he worked as a barnstorming pilot.&lt;ref name=Barson&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barson|first1=Michael|title=Howard Hawks, American director|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Howard-Hawks|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=7 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was then sent to [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] in [[New Hampshire]] from 1913 to 1914; his family's wealth may have influenced his acceptance to the elite private school. Even though he was seventeen, he was admitted as a lower middleclassman, the equivalent of a [[sophomore]]. While in [[New England]], Hawks often attended the theaters in nearby [[Boston]]. In 1914, Hawks returned to Glendora and graduated from Pasadena High School that year.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|36}}&lt;!--guessing at the page number since I can't find it in the Google book scan--&gt;

That same year, Hawks was accepted to [[Cornell University]] in [[Ithaca, New York]], where he majored in [[mechanical engineering]] and was a member of [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]]. College friend Ray S. Ashbury remembered Hawks spending more of his time playing [[craps]] and drinking alcohol than studying, although Hawks was also known to be a voracious reader of popular American and English novels in college.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|36–39}}

While working in the film industry during his 1916 summer vacation, Hawks made an unsuccessful attempt to transfer to [[Stanford University]]. He returned to Cornell that September, leaving in April 1917 to join the [[United States Army|Army]] when the [[United States]] entered [[World War I]]. Like many college students who joined the armed services during the war, he received a degree in absentia in 1918. Before Hawks was called for active duty, he returned to [[Hollywood]] and by the end of April 1917 was working on a [[Cecil B. DeMille]] film.

==Early film career==
In 1916, Hawks met [[Victor Fleming]], a Hollywood cinematographer who had been an auto mechanic and early aviator. Fleming had become involved in the film industry when a friend, [[Marshall Neilan]], recommended Fleming to film director [[Allan Dwan]] as a good mechanic. (Fleming impressed Dwan by quickly fixing both his car and a faulty film camera.) By 1916, Fleming had become a [[cinematographer]].

Hawks met Fleming when he began racing and working on a [[Mercer (automobile)|Mercer]] [[race car]]—bought for him by his grandfather, C.W. Howard—during his 1916 summer vacation in California. He allegedly met Fleming when the two men raced on a dirt track and caused an accident.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|39–42}}  &lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|39–42}}

The meeting with [[Victor Fleming|Fleming]] led to Hawks' first job in the [[film industry]], as a [[Theatrical property|prop boy]] on the [[Douglas Fairbanks]] film ''[[In Again, Out Again]]'' (on which Fleming was employed as the cinematographer) for [[Famous Players-Lasky]].&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|42–44}} According to Hawks, a new set needed to be built quickly when the studio's [[set designer]] was unavailable, so Hawks volunteered to do the job himself, much to Fairbanks' satisfaction. He was next employed as a prop boy and general assistant on an unspecified film directed by [[Cecil B. DeMille]]. (Hawks never named the film in later interviews and DeMille made five films roughly in that time period).

By the end of April 1917 Hawks was working on Cecil B. DeMille's ''[[The Little American]]''. (On this film he met and befriended the then 18-year-old [[Clapperboard|slate boy]] [[James Wong Howe]], who was to become one of Hollywood's most significant [[cinematographer]]s.)&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|42–44}} Hawks then worked on the [[Mary Pickford]] film ''[[The Little Princess (1917 film)|The Little Princess]]'', directed by [[Marshall Neilan]]. According to Hawks, Neilan did not show up to work one day, so the resourceful Hawks offered to direct a scene himself, to which Pickford consented.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|44}}&lt;ref name="Breivold"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Breivold|first1=Scott|title=Howard Hawks: Interviews|date=February 2006|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|isbn=978-1-57806-833-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WMxmjwp1a10C&amp;pg=PA74|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|74}}

Hawks began directing at age 21 after he and cinematographer [[Charles Rosher]] filmed a [[double exposure]] dream sequence with Mary Pickford. Hawks worked with Pickford and Neilan again on ''[[Amarilly of Clothes-Line Alley]]'' before joining the [[United States Army Air Service]].

Hawks' military records were destroyed in the [[National Personnel Records Center fire|1973 Military Archive Fire]], so the only account of his military service is his own. According to Hawks, he spent 15 weeks in basic training at the [[University of California in Berkeley]] where he was trained to be a [[Commander (United States)#U.S. Air Force|squadron commander]] in the air force. When Pickford visited Hawks at basic training, his superior officers were so impressed by the appearance of the celebrity that they promoted him to [[flight instructor]] and sent him to [[Texas]] to teach new recruits. Bored by this work, Hawks attempted to secure a transfer during the first half of 1918 and was eventually sent to [[Fort Monroe, Virginia]]. The [[Armistice with Germany|Armistice]] was signed in November of that year, and Hawks was discharged as a [[Second Lieutenant#United States|Second Lieutenant]] without having seen active duty.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|45–47}}&lt;ref name=Wakeman2/&gt;

After the war, Hawks was eager to return to Hollywood. His brother, Kenneth Hawks, who had also served in the Air Force, graduated from [[Yale University]] in 1919, and the two of them moved to Hollywood together to pursue their careers. They quickly made friends with Hollywood insider (and fellow Ivy Leaguer) [[Allan Dwan]].

Hawks landed his first important job when he used his family's wealth to loan money to studio head [[Jack L. Warner]]. Warner quickly paid back the loan and hired Hawks as a producer to "oversee" the making of a new [[Serial film|series]] of [[short films|one-reel]] comedies starring the Italian comedian [[Monty Banks]]. Hawks later stated that he personally directed "three or four" of the shorts, though no documentation exists to confirm the claim. The films were profitable, but Hawks soon left to form his own production company using his family's wealth and connections to secure financing.

The production company, ''Associated Producers,'' was a joint venture between Hawks, Allan Dwan, [[Marshall Neilan]], and director [[Allen Holubar]], with a distribution deal with [[First National Pictures|First National]]. The company made 14 films between 1920 and 1923, with 8 directed by Neilan, 3 by Dwan and 3 by Holubar.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|49–52}} More of a "boy's club" than a production company, the four men gradually drifted apart and went their separate ways in 1923, by which time Hawks had decided that he wanted to direct rather than produce.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|56}}

Beginning in early 1920, Hawks lived in rented houses in Hollywood with the group of friends he was accumulating. This rowdy group of mostly macho, risk-taking men included his brother Kenneth Hawks, [[Victor Fleming]], [[Jack Conway (filmmaker)|Jack Conway]], [[Harold Rosson]], [[Richard Rosson (filmmaker)|Richard Rosson]], [[Arthur Rosson]] and [[Eddie Sutherland]]. During this time, Hawks first met [[Irving Thalberg]], the frail and sickly vice-President in charge of production at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. (Eventually many of the young men in this group would become successful at MGM under Thalberg. Hawks admired his intelligence and sense of story.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|57–58}}) Hawks also became friends with barn stormers and pioneer [[aviators]] at Rogers Airport in Los Angeles, getting to know men like [[Moye Stephens]].

In 1923, [[Famous Players-Lasky]] president [[Jesse Lasky]] was looking for a new Production Editor in the story department of his studio and Thalberg suggested Hawks.&lt;ref name=Wakeman2/&gt; Hawks accepted and was immediately put in charge of over 40 productions, including several literary acquisitions of stories by [[Joseph Conrad]], [[Jack London]] and [[Zane Grey]]. Hawks worked on the scripts for all of the films produced, but he had his first official screenplay credit in 1924 on ''Tiger Love''.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|59–60}} Hawks was the Story Editor at Famous Players (later [[Paramount Pictures]]) for almost two years, occasionally editing such films as ''[[Heritage of the Desert (1924 film)|Heritage of the Desert]]''.

Hawks signed a new one-year contract with Famous-Players in the fall of 1924. He broke his contract to become a story editor for Thalberg at MGM, having secured a promise from Thalberg to make him a director within a year. In 1925, when Thalberg hesitated to keep his promise, Hawks broke his contract at MGM and left.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|60–63}}

==Career as a film director==

===Silent films: 1925–1929===
In October 1925, [[Sol Wurtzel]], [[William Fox (producer)|William Fox]]'s studio superintendent at the [[20th Century Fox|Fox Film Corporation]], invited Hawks to join his company with the promise of letting Hawks direct. Over the next three years, Hawks directed his first eight films (six silent, two "[[sound films|talkies]]").&lt;ref name=Wakeman2/&gt;  (A few months after joining Fox, Kenneth Hawks was also hired and eventually became one of Fox's top production supervisors.)&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|64–65}} Hawks reworked the scripts of most of the films he directed without always taking official credit for his work. He also worked on the scripts for ''Honesty – The Best Policy'' in 1926&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|71–74}} and [[Joseph von Sternberg]]'s ''[[Underworld (1927 film)|Underworld]]'' in 1927, famous for being one of the first [[gangster film]]s.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|76}}

Also at this time in 1926, Hawks was introduced to [[Athole Shearer]] by his friend [[Victor Fleming]], who was dating Athole's sister [[Norma Shearer]]. Athole's first marriage to writer John Ward had been unhappy. She and Hawks began dating throughout 1927, which led Shearer to ask Ward for a divorce in 1928. Shearer had a young son with Ward named Peter.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|78–81}} Hawks and Athole Shearer married on May 28, 1928, and they honeymooned in [[Hawaii]].&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|95–96}} Hawks and Shearer had their first child, David Hawks.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|105}}

At the same time, Kenneth Hawks began dating actress [[Mary Astor]], while Hawks' youngest brother Bill began dating actress [[Bessie Love]]. Kenneth Hawks and Mary Astor eventually married in February 1928,&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|81–83}} while Bill Hawks and Bessie Love married in December 1929.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|106}}

Hawks' sister Grace died of [[tuberculosis]] on December 23, 1927, after Hawks' mother refused to allow medical treatment because of her [[Christian Science]] beliefs,&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|82}}

Hawks' contract with Fox ended in May 1929, and he never again signed a long-term contract with a major studio. He managed to remain an independent producer-director for the rest of his long career.&lt;ref name=Wakeman2/&gt; In October 1929,

'''''The Road to Glory'' (1926)'''

Hawks' first film ''The Road to Glory'' was based on a 35-page treatment that Hawks wrote and is one of only two Hawks works that are [[lost film]]s. The film starred [[May McAvoy]] as a young woman who is gradually going blind and tries to spare the two men in her life from the burden of her illness. The two men are her boyfriend [[Rockliffe Fellowes]] and her father [[Ford Sterling]], with [[Leslie Fenton]] playing the greedy rich man whom she agrees to live with in order to get away from her father and lover. The film contained religious iconography and messages that would never again be seen in a Hawks film. It was shot from December 1925 to January 1926 and premiered in April. It received good reviews from film critics. In later interviews, Hawks said, "It didn't have any fun in it. It was pretty bad. I don't think anybody enjoyed it except a few critics." Hawks was dissatisfied with the film after being certain that dramatic films would establish his reputation, but realized what he had done wrong when [[Sol Wurtzel]] told Hawks, "Look, you've shown you can make a picture, but for God's sake, go out and make entertainment."&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|65–68}}

'''''Fig Leaves'' (1926)'''
[[File:Fig-leaves-1926.jpg|thumb|Poster for the comedy ''Fig Leaves'' (1926), one of the few early films Hawks valued positively later in his life.]]
Immediately after completing ''The Road to Glory'', Hawks began writing his next film, ''[[Fig Leaves]]'', his first (and, until 1935, only) comedy. The film portrays a married couple by juxtaposing them in the [[Garden of Eden]] and in modern [[New York City]]. The Garden of Eden humorously depicts Adam and Eve awoken by a [[Flintstones]]-like coconut alarm clock and Adam reading the morning news on giant stone tablets. In the modern day, the biblical serpent is replaced by Eve's gossiping neighbor and Eve becomes a sexy [[flapper]] and fashion model when Adam is at work. The film starred [[George O'Brien (actor)|George O'Brien]] as Adam and [[Olive Borden]] as Eve and received positive reviews, particularly for the art direction and costume designs. It was released in July 1926 and was Hawks' first hit as a director. Although he mainly dismissed his early work, Hawks praised this film in later interviews.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|69–71}}

'''''Paid to Love'' (1927)'''

''[[Paid to Love]]'' is notable in Hawks' filmography as being the only time that he made a highly stylized, experimental film. He attempted to imitate the style of German film director [[F. W. Murnau]], who had recently made ''[[The Last Laugh (1924 film)|The Last Laugh]]'' and ''[[Sunrise (film)|Sunrise]]'' and was the most critically acclaimed director in Hollywood. Hawks' film includes atypical tracking shots, expressionistic lighting and stylistic film editing that was inspired by [[German Expressionism|German Expressionist]] cinema. In a later interview, Hawks commented "It isn't my type of stuff, at least I got it over in a hurry. You know the idea of wanting the camera to do those things: Now the camera's somebody's eyes." Hawks worked on the script with [[Seton I. Miller]], with whom he would go on to collaborate on seven more films. The film stars [[George O'Brien (actor)|George O'Brien]] as the introverted Crown Prince Michael, [[William Powell]] as his happy-go-lucky brother and [[Virginia Valli]] as Michael's flapper love interest Dolores. The characters played by Valli and O'Brien anticipate those found in later films by Hawks: a sexually aggressive showgirl, who is an early prototype of the "[[Hawksian woman]]", and a shy man disinterested in sex, found in later roles played by [[Cary Grant]] and [[Gary Cooper]]. ''Paid to Love'' was completed by September 1926, but remained unreleased until July 1927, when it was financially unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|72–75}}

'''''Cradle Snatchers'' (1927)'''

''[[Cradle Snatchers]]'' was based on a 1925 hit stage play by Russell G. Medcraft and Norma Mitchell about three unhappy, middle-aged housewives who teach their adulterous husbands a lesson by starting affairs with college-aged young men during the [[jazz age]]. The film starred [[Louise Fazenda]], [[Dorothy Phillips]] and [[Ethel Wales]] and was shot in early 1927. The film was released in May 1927 and was a minor hit. For many years it was believed to be a [[lost film]] until film director [[Peter Bogdanovich]] discovered a print in 20th Century Fox's film vaults, although the print was missing part of reel three and all of reel four.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|76–78}}

'''''Fazil'' (1928)'''

In March 1927, Hawks signed a new one-year, three-picture contract with Fox and was assigned to direct ''Fazil'', based on the play ''L'Insoumise'' by [[Pierre Frondaie]]. Hawks again worked with Seton Miller on the script about a Middle Eastern prince who has an affair with a Parisienne showgirl and cast [[Charles Farrell]] as the prince and [[Greta Nissen]] as Fabienne. Hawks went both over schedule and over budget on the film, which began a rift between him and Sol Wurtzel that would eventually lead to Hawks leaving Fox. The film was finished in August 1927, though it was not released until June 1928.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|84–86}}

'''''A Girl in Every Port'' (1928)'''

[[File:A Girl in Every Port poster.jpg|thumb|left|''A Girl in Every Port'' poster]]
''[[A Girl in Every Port (1928 film)|A Girl in Every Port]]'' is considered by film scholars to be the most important film of Hawks' silent career. It is the first of his films to utilize many of the Hawksian themes and characters that would define much of his subsequent work. It was his first "love story between two men," with two men bonding over their duty, skills and careers, who consider their friendship to be more important than their relationships with women. Hawks wrote the original story and developed the screenplay with [[James Kevin McGuinness]] and Seton Miller. In the film [[Victor McLaglen]] and [[Robert Armstrong (actor)|Robert Armstrong]] play two merchant seamen who are archrivals when it comes to women, with McLaglen constantly finding Armstrong's tattoo on the women that he is attempting to seduce. Eventually the two rivals become friends. [[Louise Brooks]] plays the cabaret singer with whom the two men fall in love. The film was shot from October to December 1927 and released in February 1928. It was successful in the US, and a hit in Europe where Louise Brooks was developing a cult following.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|86–91}} In France, [[Henri Langlois]] called Hawks "the [[Walter Gropius|Gropius]] of the cinema" and Swiss novelist and poet [[Blaise Cendrars]] said that the film "definitely marked the first appearance of contemporary cinema."&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|92}} Hawks went over budget once again with this film, though, and his relationship with Sol Wurtzel deteriorated. After an advance screening that received positive reviews, Wurtzel told Hawks, "This is the worst picture Fox has made in years."&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|91}}

'''''The Air Circus'' (1928)'''

''[[The Air Circus]]'' is Hawks' first film centered around [[aviation]], one of his early passions. In 1928, [[Charles Lindbergh]] was the world's most famous person and ''[[Wings (1927 film)|Wings]]'' was one of the most popular films of the year. Wanting to capitalize on the country's aviation craze, Fox immediately bought Hawks' original story for ''The Air Circus'', a variation of the male friendship plot of ''A Girl in Every Port'' about two young pilots. Officially, the original story is credited to Graham Baker and Andrew Bennison, while the screenplay was written by Seton Miller and [[Norman Z. McLeod]]. In the film, [[Arthur Lake (actor)|Arthur Lake]] and David Rollins play two eager young pilots at flight school who compete over their flight instructor's aviatrix sister, played by [[Sue Carol]]. The film was shot from April to June 1928, but Fox ordered an additional 15 minutes of dialogue footage in order that the film could compete with the new "[[sound films|talkies]]" being released. Hawks hated the new dialogue written by [[Hugh Herbert]] and he refused to participate in the re-shoots. The film was released in September 1928 and was a moderate hit. It is one of two films directed by Hawks that are [[lost film]]s.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|92–94}}

'''''Trent's Last Case'' (1929)'''

''[[Trent's Last Case (1929 film)|Trent's Last Case]]'' is an adaptation of British author [[E. C. Bentley]]'s [[Trent's Last Case|1913 novel of the same name]], which had already been adapted for cinema [[Trent's Last Case (1920 film)|in England in 1920]]. Hawks considered the novel to be "one of the greatest detective stories of all time" and was eager to make it his first sound film. He cast [[Raymond Griffith]] in the lead role of Phillip Trent. Griffith's throat had been damaged by poison gas during World War I and his voice was a hoarse whisper, prompting Hawks to later state, "I thought he ought to be great in talking pictures ''because'' of that voice." However, after shooting only a few scenes, Fox shut Hawks down and ordered him to make a silent film, both because of Griffith's voice and because they only owned the legal rights to make a silent film. The film did have a musical score and synchronized sound effects, but no dialogue. Due to the failing business of silent films, it was never released in the US and only briefly screened in England where film critics hated it. The film was believed lost until the mid-1970s and was screened for the first time in the US at a Hawks retrospective in 1974. Hawks was in attendance of the screening and attempted to have the only print of the film destroyed.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|97–101}}
[[File:Howard Hawks Hearts In Exile.jpg|thumb|Howard Hawks in 1929 or 1930]]

===Early sound films: 1930–1934===
By 1930, Hollywood was in upheaval over the coming of "talkies" and the careers of many actors and directors were ruined. Hollywood studios were recruiting stage actors and directors that they believed were better suited for sound films. After having worked in the industry for 14 years and directed many financially successful films, Hawks found himself having to prove himself an asset to the studios once again. Leaving Fox on sour terms didn't help his reputation, but Hawks was one of the few people in Hollywood who never backed down from fights with studio heads. After several months of unemployment, Hawks renewed his career with his first sound film in 1930.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|102}}

On January 2, 1930, Hawks' brother [[Kenneth Hawks]] died while shooting the film ''[[Such Men Are Dangerous]]''.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|106–109}} Kenneth's career as a director had been gathering momentum after his debut film ''[[Big Time (1929 film)|Big Time]]'' in 1929. This sound film starred [[Lee Tracy]] and [[Mae Clarke]] and was an early example of the "fast-talking" sound films that would later become one of Howard Hawks' signatures.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|100–101}} ''Such Men Are Dangerous'' was based on the life [[Alfred Lowenstein]], a Belgian captain who either jumped or fell out of his plane in 1928. On January 2, Kenneth Hawks and his crew flew three aircraft (two with cameras, one with a stunt actor) over [[Santa Monica Bay]] when the two camera aircraft crashed into each other, killing 10 men. The crash was the first major on-set accident in Hollywood history and made national news. Mary Astor kept her distance from the Hawks family after Kenneth's death.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|106–110}}

'''''The Dawn Patrol'' (1930)'''

[[File:Dawn-Patrol-1930-Poster.jpg|thumb|''The Dawn Patrol'' movie poster]]
Hawks' first all sound film was ''[[The Dawn Patrol (1930 film)|The Dawn Patrol]]'', based on an original story by [[John Monk Saunders]] and (unofficially) Hawks. Saunders was a flight instructor during World War I and had written ''[[Wings (1927 film)|Wings]]''. He was considered one of the most talented writers in Hollywood and was often compared to [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]]. Accounts vary on who came up with the idea of the film, but Hawks and Saunders developed the story together and tried to sell it to several studios before First National agreed to produce it.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|102–105}} Saunders received solo screen credit for the original story and won an [[Academy Award for Best Story]] in 1930. The screenplay was written by Hawks, Seton Miller and Dan Totheroh and starred [[Richard Barthelmess]] and [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr]]. Shooting began in late February 1930, about the same time that [[Howard Hughes]] was finally finishing his epic World War I aviation epic ''[[Hell's Angels (film)|Hell's Angels]]'', which had been in production since September 1927. Shrewdly, Hawks began to hire many of the aviation experts and cameramen that had been employed by Hughes, including [[Elmer Dyer]], Harry Reynolds and Ira Reed. When Hughes found out about the rival film, he did everything he could to sabotage ''The Dawn Patrol''. He harassed Hawks and other studio personal, hired a spy that was quickly caught and finally sued First National for copyright infringement. Hughes eventually dropped the lawsuit in late 1930—he and Hawks had become good friends during the legal battle. In the film, Barthelmess and Fairbanks play two [[Royal Flying Corps]] pilots during World War I who deal with the pressure of wartime combat and constant death by drinking and fighting with their commanding officer. Filming was finished in late May 1930 and it premiered in July, setting a first-week box office record at the [[Winter Garden Theatre]] in New York. The film became one of the biggest hits of 1930.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|111–115}}

'''''The Criminal Code'' (1931)'''

[[File:Criminal Code.jpg|thumb|left|''The Criminal Code'' poster]]
Hawks did not get along with Warner Brothers executive [[Hal B. Wallis]] and his contract allowed him to be loaned out to other studios. Hawks took the opportunity to accept a directing offer from [[Harry Cohn]] at [[Columbia Pictures]]: ''[[The Criminal Code]]'', based on a successful play by [[Martin Flavin]]. Hawks and Seton Miller worked on the script with Flavin for a month and filming began in September 1930. The film starred [[Walter Huston]], [[Phillips Holmes]], [[Constance Cummings]] and [[Boris Karloff]]. Huston plays a prison warden who wants to reform the conditions of the inmates and Holmes plays a wrongly convicted prisoner who learns about the "code" of not ratting on other inmates. Hawks called Huston "the greatest actor I ever worked with".&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|118–119}} Hawks also worked with his old friend [[James Wong Howe]] for the first time as a cinematographer. The film opened in January 1931 and was a hit. The film was banned in Chicago, though, and the experience of censorship which would continue in his next film project.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|120–121}}

'''''Scarface'' (1932)'''

In 1930, [[Howard Hughes]] hired Hawks to direct ''[[Scarface (1932 film)|Scarface]]'', a gangster film loosely based on the life of Chicago mobster [[Al Capone]]. The film starred [[Paul Muni]] in the title role, with memorable supporting performances from [[George Raft]], [[Boris Karloff]], and [[Osgood Perkins]]. The film was completed in September 1931, but the censorship of the [[Hays Code]] prevented it from being released as Hawks and Hughes had originally intended. The two men fought, negotiated and made compromises with the Hays Office for over a year, until the film was eventually released in 1932, after such other pivotal early gangster films as ''[[The Public Enemy]]'' and ''[[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]]''. ''Scarface'' was the first film in which Hawks worked with screenwriter [[Ben Hecht]], who became a close friend and collaborator for 20 years.&lt;ref name=Wakeman2/&gt;

'''''The Crowd Roars'' (1932)'''

After filming was complete on ''Scarface'', Hawks left Hughes to fight the legal battles and returned to First National to fulfill his contract, this time with producer [[Darryl F. Zanuck]]. For his next film, Hawks wanted to make a film about his childhood passion: car racing. ''[[The Crowd Roars (1932 film)|The Crowd Roars]]'' is loosely based on the play ''The Barker: A Play of Carnival Life'' by [[Kenyon Nicholson]]. Hawks developed the script with Seton Miller for their eighth and final collaboration and the script was by Miller, [[Kubec Glasmon]], [[John Bright (screenwriter)|John Bright]] and [[Niven Busch]]. The film starred [[James Cagney]], [[Eric Linden]], [[Joan Blondell]] and [[Ann Dvorak]]. In the film, Cagney plays a race car driver who tries to "protect" his younger brother Linden, who is also a driver, from being distracted by his girlfriend, Blondell. At the same time, Cagney must hide his own neurotic girlfriend, played by Dvorak, from his younger brother. Blondell and Dvorak were initially cast in each other's roles but swapped after a few days of shooting. Shooting began on December 7, 1931 at Legion Ascot Speedway and wrapped on February 1, 1932. Hawks used real race car drivers in the film, including the [[1930 Indianapolis 500]] winner [[Billy Arnold (racing driver)|Billy Arnold]].&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|156–162}} The film was released in March and became a hit.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|172}}

'''''Tiger Shark'' (1932)'''

[[File:Tiger Shark 1932 poster.jpg|thumb|''Tiger Shark'' poster]]
Later in 1932, he directed ''[[Tiger Shark (film)|Tiger Shark]]'' starring [[Edward G. Robinson]] as a tuna fisherman. In these early films, Hawks established the prototypical "Hawksian Man", which film critic [[Andrew Sarris]] described as "upheld by an instinctive professionalism."&lt;ref name=Wakeman2/&gt; ''Tiger Shark'' demonstrated Hawks' ability to incorporate touches of humor into dramatic, tense, and even tragic story lines.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|172}}

'''''Today We Live'' (1933)'''

In 1933, Hawks signed a three-picture deal at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] Studios, the first of which was ''[[Today We Live]]'' in 1933, starring [[Joan Crawford]] and [[Gary Cooper]]. This [[World War I]] film was based on a [[short story]] by author [[William Faulkner]], with whom Hawks would remain friends for over 20 years.&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt;{{rp|173–187}}

Hawks' next two films at MGM were the [[boxing]] drama ''[[The Prizefighter and the Lady]]'' and the [[biographical film|bio-pic]] ''[[Viva Villa!]]'', starring [[Wallace Beery]] as Mexican Revolutionary leader [[Pancho Villa]]. Studio interference on both films led Hawks to walk out on his MGM contract without completing either film himself.&lt;ref name=Wakeman2/&gt;

===Later sound films===
In 1934, Hawks went to [[Columbia Pictures]] to make his first [[Screwball comedy film|screwball comedy]], ''[[Twentieth Century (film)|Twentieth Century]]'', starring [[John Barrymore]] and Hawks' distant cousin [[Carole Lombard]]. It was based on a stage play by [[Ben Hecht]] and [[Charles MacArthur]] and, along with [[Frank Capra]]'s ''[[It Happened One Night]]'' (released the same year), is considered to be the defining film of the screwball comedy genre. In 1935, Hawks made ''[[Barbary Coast (film)|Barbary Coast]]'' with [[Edward G. Robinson]] and [[Miriam Hopkins]]. In 1936, he made the aviation adventure ''[[Ceiling Zero]]'' with [[James Cagney]] and [[Pat O'Brien (actor)|Pat O'Brien]]. Also in 1936, Hawks began filming ''[[Come and Get It (1936 film)|Come and Get It]]'', starring [[Edward Arnold (actor)|Edward Arnold]], [[Joel McCrea]], [[Frances Farmer]] and [[Walter Brennan]]. But he was fired by [[Samuel Goldwyn]] in the middle of shooting and the film was completed by [[William Wyler]].&lt;ref name=Wakeman2/&gt;

In 1938, Hawks made the screwball comedy ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'' for [[RKO Pictures]]. It starred [[Cary Grant]] and [[Katharine Hepburn]] and has been called "the screwiest of the screwball comedies" by film critic [[Andrew Sarris]]. Grant plays a near-sighted paleontologist who suffers one humiliation after another due to the lovestruck socialite played by Hepburn.&lt;ref name=Wakeman2/&gt; Hawks' artistic direction for ''Bringing Up Baby'' revolved around the raw natural chemistry between Grant and Hepburn. With Grant portraying the paleontologist and Hepburn as an heiress, the roles only add to the movie's purpose of disintegrating the line between the real and the imaginary.&lt;ref name="films of" /&gt;''Bringing Up Baby'' was a box office flop when initially released and, subsequently, RKO fired Hawks due to extreme losses; however, the film has become regarded as one of Hawks' masterpieces.&lt;ref name="Laham"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Laham|first1=Nicholas|title=Currents of Comedy on the American Screen: How Film and Television Deliver Different Laughs for Changing Times|date=May 2009|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786442645|pages=27–29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CsqL5zpWX7cC&amp;pg=PA27|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawks followed this with the aviation drama ''[[Only Angels Have Wings]]'', again starring [[Cary Grant]] and made in 1939 for [[Columbia Pictures]]. It also starred [[Jean Arthur]], [[Thomas Mitchell (actor)|Thomas Mitchell]], [[Rita Hayworth]], and [[Richard Barthelmess]].&lt;ref name=Wakeman2/&gt;

[[File:His Girl Friday still 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cary Grant]], [[Rosalind Russell]] and [[Ralph Bellamy]] in ''[[His Girl Friday]]'' (1940)]]

In 1940, Hawks returned to the screwball comedy genre with ''[[His Girl Friday]]'', starring [[Cary Grant]] and [[Rosalind Russell]]. The film was an adaptation of the hit Broadway play ''[[The Front Page]]'' by [[Ben Hecht]] and [[Charles MacArthur]],&lt;ref name="Wakeman2" /&gt; which had already been made into a [[The Front Page (1931 film)|film in 1931]] and had also been reworked by the same screenwriters and transplanted to [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s India for ''[[Gunga Din (film)|Gunga Din]]'' in 1939.&lt;ref name="Moss"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moss|first1=Marilyn Ann|title=Giant: George Stevens, a Life on Film|date=August 2015|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=9780299204341|page=57|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iPEhCJbul9QC&amp;pg=PA57|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, Hawks made ''[[Sergeant York (film)|Sergeant York]]'', starring [[Gary Cooper]] as a pacifist farmer who becomes a decorated [[World War I]] soldier. This was the highest-grossing film of 1941 and won two [[Academy Awards]] ([[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Editing]]), as well as earning Hawks his only nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]. Later that year, Hawks worked with Cooper again for ''[[Ball of Fire]]'', which also starred [[Barbara Stanwyck]]. The film was written by [[Billy Wilder]] and [[Charles Brackett]] and is a playful take on ''[[Snow White|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''. Cooper plays a sheltered, intellectual linguist who is writing an encyclopedia with six other scientists, and hires street-wise Stanwyck to help them with modern slang terms. In 1941, Hawks began work on the [[Howard Hughes]]-produced (and later directed) film ''[[The Outlaw]]'', based on the life of [[Billy the Kid]] and starring [[Jane Russell]]. Hawks completed initial shooting of the film in early 1941, but due to perfectionism and battles with the Hollywood [[Production Code]], Hughes continued to re-shoot and re-edit the film until 1943, when it was finally released with Hawks uncredited as director.&lt;ref name=Wakeman2/&gt;

After making the [[World War II]] film ''[[Air Force (film)|Air Force]]'' in 1943 starring [[John Garfield]], Hawks did two films with real-life lovers [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Lauren Bacall]]. ''[[To Have and Have Not (film)|To Have and Have Not]]'', made in 1944, stars Bogart, Bacall and [[Walter Brennan]] and is based on a novel by [[Ernest Hemingway]]. Hawks was a close friend of Hemingway and made a bet with the author that he could make a good film out of Hemingway's "worst book." Hawks, [[William Faulkner]] and [[Jules Furthman]] collaborated on the script about an American fishing boat captain working out of French Martinique in the Caribbean and various situations of espionage after the [[Fall of France]] in 1940. Bogart and Bacall fell in love on the set of the film and married soon afterwards. ''To Have and Have Not'' has been critiqued as having a "rambling, slapped-together feel" that contribute to an overall clumsy and dull movie.&lt;ref name="films of"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Willis|first1=Donald C.|title=The Films of Howard Hawks|date=1975|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Metuchen, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|60}} The film, however, has also been enjoyed for its romantic plot and has been compared to Casablanca in its feel.&lt;ref name="focus on"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McBride|first1=Joseph|title=Focus on Howard Hawks|date=1972|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} The greatest strength of the movie has been said to come from its atmosphere and use of wit that really plays on the strengths of Bacall and helps the movie solidify the theme of beauty in perpetual opposition.&lt;ref name="films of" /&gt;{{rp|75}}Hawks reteamed with Bogart and Bacall in 1946 with ''[[The Big Sleep (1946 film)|The Big Sleep]]'', based on the [[Philip Marlowe]] detective novel by [[Raymond Chandler]].&lt;ref name=Wakeman2/&gt;

In 1948, Hawks made ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]'', an epic western reminiscent of ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty]]'' starring [[John Wayne]] and [[Montgomery Clift]] in his first film. Later that year, Hawks remade his earlier film ''[[Ball of Fire]]'' as ''[[A Song Is Born]]'', this time starring [[Danny Kaye]] and [[Virginia Mayo]]. This version follows the same plot but pays more attention to popular [[jazz]] music and includes such jazz legends as [[Tommy Dorsey]], [[Benny Goodman]], [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Lionel Hampton]], and [[Benny Carter]] playing themselves. In 1949, Hawks reteamed with Cary Grant in the screwball comedy ''[[I Was a Male War Bride]]'', also starring [[Ann Sheridan]].&lt;ref name=Wakeman2/&gt;

[[File:Film1951-TheThingFromAnotherWorld-OriginalPoster.jpg|thumb|''The Thing From Another World'' poster]]
In 1951, Hawks produced, and some believe essentially directed, a science-fiction film, ''[[The Thing from Another World]]''. Director John Carpenter stated: "And let's get the record straight. The movie was directed by Howard Hawks. Verifiably directed by Howard Hawks. He let his editor, [[Christian Nyby]], take credit. But the kind of feeling between the male characters—the camaraderie, the group of men that has to fight off the evil—it's all pure Hawksian."&lt;ref name="hvm50"&gt;Carpenter, John (speaker).

Retrieved: April 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  He followed this with the 1952 western film ''[[The Big Sky (film)|The Big Sky]]'', starring [[Kirk Douglas]]. Later in 1952, Hawks work with Cary Grant for the fifth and final time in the screwball comedy ''[[Monkey Business (1952 film)|Monkey Business]]'', which also starred [[Marilyn Monroe]] and [[Ginger Rogers]]. Grant plays a scientist (reminiscent of his character in ''Bringing up Baby'') who creates a formula that increases his vitality. Film critic John Belton called the film Hawks' "most organic comedy."&lt;ref name=Wakeman2/&gt; Hawks' third film of 1952 was a contribution to the omnibus film ''[[O. Henry's Full House]]'', which includes short stories by the writer [[O. Henry]] made by various directors.&lt;ref name="variety O Henry"&gt;{{cite news|title=Review: 'O.

In 1953, Hawks made ''[[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953 film)|Gentlemen Prefer Blondes]]'', which featured [[Marilyn Monroe]] famously singing "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend." The film starred Monroe and [[Jane Russell]] as two gold-digging, cabaret-performer best friends that many critics argue is the only female version of his celebrated "buddy film" genre that he made. In 1955, Hawks shot a film atypical within the context of his other work, ''[[Land of the Pharaohs]]'', which is a [[sword-and-sandal]] epic about ancient Egypt that stars [[Jack Hawkins]] and [[Joan Collins]]. The film was Hawks' final collaboration with longtime friend William Faulkner before the author's death. In 1959, Hawks worked with [[John Wayne]] in ''[[Rio Bravo (movie)|Rio Bravo]]'', also starring [[Dean Martin]], [[Ricky Nelson]], and [[Walter Brennan]] as four lawmen "defending the fort" of their local jail in which a local criminal is awaiting a trial while his family attempt to break him out. Film critic [[Robin Wood (critic)|Robin Wood]] has said that if he "were asked to choose a film that would justify the existence of Hollywood&amp;nbsp;... it would be ''Rio Bravo''."&lt;ref name=Wakeman2/&gt;

[[File:Howard Hawks On A Motorcycle Car.jpg|thumb|Howard Hawks On A Motorcycle Car]]
In 1962, Hawks made ''[[Hatari!]]'', again with John Wayne, who plays a wild animals catcher in Africa. In 1964, Hawks made his final comedy, ''[[Man's Favorite Sport?]]'', starring [[Rock Hudson]] (since Cary Grant felt he was too old for the role) and [[Paula Prentiss]]. Hawks then returned to his childhood passion for car races with ''[[Red Line 7000]]'' in 1965, featuring a young [[James Caan]] in his first leading role. Hawks' final two films were both Western remakes of ''Rio Bravo'' starring John Wayne. In 1966, Hawks directed ''[[El Dorado (1966 film)|El Dorado]]'', starring Wayne, [[Robert Mitchum]], and Caan, which was released the following year. He then made ''[[Rio Lobo]]'', with Wayne in 1970.&lt;ref name=Wakeman2/&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:Howard Hawks With Slim And Dog.jpg|thumb|Howard Hawks With Slim Keith and dog]]
Hawks was married three times: to actress [[Athole Shearer]], sister of [[Norma Shearer]], from 1928–40; to socialite [[Slim Keith]] from 1941–49; and to actress [[Dee Hartford]] from 1953–60.

Hawks died on December 26, 1977, at the age of 81, from complications arising from a fall when he tripped over his dog several weeks earlier at his home in [[Palm Springs, California]]. He was working with his last protege discovery at the time, Larraine Zax.&lt;ref name="frederick daily"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4FRDAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mK0MAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=palm-springs&amp;pg=4362%2C6091182|title=Howard Hawks, age 81 dies in Palm Springa|work=Frederick Daily Leader|date=28 Dec 1977|access-date=30 Sep 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
[[File:Bacall&amp;Hawks.jpg|thumb|right|Hawks and [[Lauren Bacall]], 1943]]
Hawks was a versatile director whose career includes comedies, dramas, gangster films, science fiction, film noir, and Westerns. Hawks' own functional definition of what constitutes a "good movie" is characteristic of his no-nonsense style: "Three great scenes, no bad ones."&lt;ref name="Breivold" /&gt;{{rp|63}}&lt;ref name=historyfilm/&gt; Hawks also defined a good director as "someone who doesn't annoy you."&lt;ref name="Huffington Post"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Farr|first1=John|title=Genius Uncovered: The Film Legacy of Howard Hawk|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-farr/genius-uncovered-the-time_b_1533671.html|accessdate=26 July 2016|work=Huffington Post|date=5 Apr 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hawks' own words, his directing style is based on being enjoyable and straightforward.&lt;ref name="hawks on hawks" &gt;{{cite book|last1=McBride|first1=Joseph|title=Hawks on Hawks|date=1982|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, California}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} His style was very actor-focused and he made it a point to take as few shots as possible, thereby preserving an inherent and natural humor for his comedic pieces.&lt;ref name="hawks on hawks" /&gt;{{rp|40}}

While Hawks was not sympathetic to [[feminism]], he popularized the [[Hawksian woman]] [[archetype]], a portrayal of women in more strong, less effeminate roles. Such an emphasis had never been done in the 1920s and therefore was seen to be a rarity and, according to Naomi Wise, has been cited as a prototype of the [[Post-feminism|post-feminist]] movement.&lt;ref name="american artist"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Hillier|editor1-first=Jim|editor2-last=Wollen|editor2-first=Peter|title=Howard Hawks: American Artist|date=April 1997|publisher=British Film Institute|isbn=978-0-85170-593-4|pages=111–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hawks on hawks" /&gt;{{rp|70}} Another notable theme carried throughout his work included the relationship of morality and human interaction. In this sense he tended to portray more dramatic elements of a concept or a plot in a humorous way.&lt;ref name="hawks on hawks" /&gt;{{rp|2}}

[[Orson Welles]] in an interview with [[Peter Bogdanovich]] said of Howard Hawks, in comparison with [[John Ford]], that "Hawks is great prose; Ford is poetry."&lt;ref&gt;Bogdanovich, Peter.

Despite Hawks' work in a variety of Hollywood genres, he still retained an independent sensibility. Film critic [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] wrote of Hawks: "Far from being the meek purveyor of Hollywood forms, he always chose to turn them upside down. ''To Have and Have Not'' and ''The Big Sleep'', ostensibly an adventure and a thriller, are really love stories. ''Rio Bravo'', apparently a Western – everyone wears a cowboy hat – is a comedy conversation piece. The ostensible comedies are shot through with exposed emotions, with the subtlest views of the sex war, and with a wry acknowledgment of the incompatibility of men and women."&lt;ref name="Thomson 1994"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomson|first1=David|title=A Biographical Dictionary of Film|date=November 1994|publisher=Knopf|isbn=9780679755647|page=322|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  David Boxwell argues that the filmmaker's body of work "has been accused of a historical and adolescent escapism, but Hawks' fans rejoice in his oeuvre's remarkable avoidance of Hollywood's religiosity, bathos, flag-waving, and sentimentality.&lt;ref&gt;Boxwell, David.

Hawks was venerated by French critics associated with ''[[Cahiers du cinéma]]'', who intellectualized his work in a way that Hawks himself found moderately amusing (his work was promoted in France by [[The Studio des Ursulines]] cinema), and though he was not taken seriously by British critics of the ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'' circle at first, other independent British writers, such as [[Robin Wood (critic)|Robin Wood]], admired his films. Wood named Hawks' ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'' as his top film of all time.&lt;ref&gt;Howell, Peter.

'''Shane Osborn''' (born June 21, 1974 in [[Loomis, South Dakota]]) is an American politician and former State Treasurer of [[Nebraska]].

==Military career==
{{main|Hainan Island incident}}

Osborn graduated from [[Norfolk, Nebraska|Norfolk]] High School in 1992 and then attended the [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln]] on a [[Naval ROTC]] scholarship. After graduating in 1996 with a degree in statistics and [[actuarial science]], Osborn was commissioned as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] in the [[United States Navy]] and entered flight training in Florida and Texas.  Subsequently designated as a [[United States naval aviator|naval aviator]], he was eventually assigned to the Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron One (VQ-1) "World Watchers" at [[NAS Whidbey Island]], Washington, flying the [[P-3 Orion|EP-3E Aries]] aircraft.

On April 1, 2001, then-Lieutenant Osborn was a patrol plane commander piloting an [[EP-3E]] aircraft with a 23-member crew about {{convert|70|mi|km}} away from the Chinese island of [[Hainan]] in international airspace&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/east/04/12/air.collision.03/index.html CNN archives]&lt;/ref&gt; when it collided with a [[Shenyang J-8|Chinese J-8IIM]] jet fighter that had intercepted the U.S. aircraft. The EP-3E's propeller cut the J-8 in half. The fighter's nose section cartwheeled upward, smashing into the EP-3E's nose and tearing off its [[radome]]. The impact sent Osborn's plane into an inverted dive, dropping 8,000 feet in 30 seconds and falling another 6,000 feet before Osborn had the EP-3E's nose up and wings level.&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0IAX/is_6_85/ai_110732276 Lt. Shane Osborn: looking at a miracle | Naval Aviation News | Find Articles at BNET.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In a September 2003 article in the ''Naval Aviation News'', Osborn told Jim Turnbull that once he regained control of the plane he "called for the crew to prepare to bail out."&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"/&gt; They donned parachutes and initiated an emergency destruct plan, which included destroying intelligence equipment and sensitive documents on board.

After an emergency landing at the Lingshui Air Base on Hainan Island, Osborn and his crew were taken to a Chinese military barracks where they were detained and interrogated for 12 days.  The aircraft was dismantled by the Chinese and returned to the US in boxes after months of scrutiny by Chinese officials.  On April 12, 2001 the crew were released from Chinese custody and returned to the United States. After the [[Hainan Island incident]], Osborn was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/19/us/awards-for-heroism-go-to-spy-plane-crew.html "Awards for Heroism Go to Spy Plane Crew".]  [https://www.nytimes.com/ ''New York Times''.]  2001-05-19.  Retrieved 2014-05-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Osborn left the Regular Navy as a [[Lieutenant Commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] after nine years of active duty and entered the [[U.S. Navy Reserve|Navy Reserve]].

'''David Jon Gilmour''', {{post-nominals|CBE}} (born 6 March 1946) is an English guitarist, singer and songwriter who was a member of the [[progressive rock]] band [[Pink Floyd]]. He joined the group as guitarist and co-lead vocalist in 1968 shortly before the departure of founding member [[Syd Barrett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/epm/10178|title=Gilmour, David|work=Encyclopedia of Popular Music|publisher=Oxford Music Online|subscription=yes|accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pink Floyd subsequently achieved international success with the [[concept album]]s ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'', ''[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]]'', ''[[Animals (Pink Floyd album)|Animals]]'', and ''[[The Wall]]''. By the early 1980s, they had become one of the bestselling and most acclaimed acts in music history; by 2012, the band had sold over 250 million records worldwide, including 75&amp;nbsp;million units sold in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;For 250 million records sold see: {{cite web|title=Pink Floyd Reunion Tops Fans' Wish List in Music Choice Survey|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aOmothQgn6l4&amp;refer=muse|publisher=[[Bloomberg Television]]|date=26 September 2007|accessdate=2 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812212513/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aOmothQgn6l4&amp;refer=muse|archivedate=12 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}; For 74.5 million RIAA certified units sold see: {{cite web|title=Top Selling Artists|publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinum.php?content_selector=top-selling-artists|accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the departure of [[Roger Waters]] in 1985, Gilmour assumed leadership of Pink Floyd; they released three more studio albums before disbanding in 2014.

Gilmour has produced a variety of artists, such as the [[The Dream Academy|Dream Academy]], and has released four solo studio albums: ''[[David Gilmour (album)|David Gilmour]]'', ''[[About Face (album)|About Face]]'', ''[[On an Island]]'', and ''[[Rattle That Lock]]''. He is also credited for bringing songwriter [[Kate Bush]] to public attention. As a member of Pink Floyd, he was inducted into the US [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1996, and the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]] in 2005. In 2005, Gilmour was made a [[Order of the British Empire|Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) for his services to music.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=378}} He was awarded with the Outstanding Contribution title at the 2008 [[Q Awards]].&lt;ref name="qawards"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.qawards.co.uk/2008/2008/10/outstanding_contribution_title.html |title=Gilmour dedicates his award to late colleague |publisher=Q Awards |accessdate=20 July 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810050010/http://www2.qawards.co.uk/2008/2008/10/outstanding_contribution_title.html |archivedate=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked him number 14 in their list of the greatest guitarists of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-20111123/david-gilmour-20111122|title=David Gilmour – 100 Greatest Guitarists – Rolling Stone|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was voted number 36 in the greatest voices in rock by [[Planet Rock (radio station)|Planet Rock]] listeners in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/robert-plant-voted-rocks-greatest-voice-190343 | title= Robert Plant voted rock's greatest voice | work=[[MusicRadar]] | date=4 January 2009 | accessdate=27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilmour has taken part in projects related to issues including [[animal rights]], environmentalism, homelessness, poverty, and human rights. He has married twice and is the father of eight children.

==Early life and education==
David Jon Gilmour was born on 6 March 1946 in [[Cambridge]], England.{{sfn|Fitch|2005|p=115}} His father, Douglas Gilmour, eventually became a senior lecturer in [[zoology]] at the University of Cambridge, and his mother, Sylvia (née Wilson), trained as a teacher and later worked as a film editor for the [[BBC]].&lt;ref name="WH"&gt;{{Cite episode |series=BBC Two |title=David Gilmour: Wider Horizons |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06pyrbs |accessdate=14 November 2015 |network=[[BBC]] |date=14 November 2015 |transcript=  |transcripturl= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of Gilmour's birth they lived in [[Trumpington]], [[Cambridgeshire]], but in 1956, after several relocations, the family moved to [[Grantchester]] Meadows.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blake|2008|p=14}}: the house in Trumpington; {{harvnb|Manning|2006|pp=10–11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|Gilmour has three siblings: Peter, Mark and Catherine.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=14}}}}

Gilmour's parents encouraged him to pursue his interest in music, and in 1954 he bought his first single, [[Bill Haley]]'s "[[Rock Around the Clock]]".{{sfn|Manning|2006|pp=10–11}} His enthusiasm for music was stirred the following year by [[Elvis Presley]]'s "[[Heartbreak Hotel]]", and later "[[Bye Bye Love (The Everly Brothers song)|Bye Bye Love]]" by [[the Everly Brothers]] piqued his interest in the guitar. He borrowed a guitar from a neighbour, but never gave it back. Soon afterward, Gilmour started teaching himself to play using a book and record set by [[Pete Seeger]].{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=18–19}} At age 11, Gilmour began attending [[the Perse School]] on Hills Road, Cambridge, which he did not enjoy.{{sfn|Manning|2006|p=11}} There he met future [[Pink Floyd]] guitarist [[Syd Barrett]] and bassist [[Roger Waters]], who attended [[Cambridgeshire High School for Boys]], which was also situated on Hills Road.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=15–17}}

In 1962, Gilmour began studying [[GCE Advanced Level (United Kingdom)|A-Level]] modern languages at Cambridge Technical College.{{sfn|Manning|2006|p=11}} Despite not finishing the course, he eventually learnt to speak fluent French.{{sfn|Manning|2006|p=11}} Barrett was also a student at the college, and he spent his lunchtimes practising guitar with Gilmour.{{sfn|Manning|2006|p=11}} In late 1962, Gilmour joined the [[blues rock]] band [[Jokers Wild (band)|Jokers Wild]]. They recorded a one-sided [[album]] and a [[single (music)|single]] at Regent Sound Studio, in west London, but only fifty copies of each were made.{{sfn|Manning|2006|p=11}} In August 1965, Gilmour [[Street performance|busked]] around Spain and France with Barrett and some other friends, performing songs by [[the Beatles]]. They were arrested on one occasion and destitute, which resulted in Gilmour requiring treatment in a hospital for [[malnutrition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Manning|2006|p=18}}: arrested for busking; {{cite web|url=http://www.megapinkfloyd.com/band_members_david_gilmour.asp |title=PINK FLOYD&amp;nbsp;– David Gilmour Photos, Biography, Apparel |publisher=Megapinkfloyd.com |accessdate=9 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714065947/http://www.megapinkfloyd.com/band_members_david_gilmour.asp |archivedate=14 July 2011}}: malnutrition.&lt;/ref&gt; He and Barrett later [[Backpacking (wilderness)|trekked]] to Paris, where they camped outside the city for a week and visited the [[Louvre]].{{sfn|Manning|2006|p=18}} During that time Gilmour worked in various places, most notably as the driver and assistant for fashion designer [[Ossie Clark]].{{sfn|Pattie Boyd: Wonderful Tonight, 2007|p=53 |loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=CNhh0TMLmmwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=wonderful+tonight&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=z3VTVb2eN4LUgwTQgoGoCA&amp;ved=0CCgQ6wEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=gilmour&amp;f=false]}}

Gilmour travelled to France in mid-1967 with [[Rick Wills]] and [[Willie Wilson (drummer)|Willie Wilson]], formerly of Jokers Wild. The trio performed under the name Flowers, then Bullitt, but were not commercially successful. After hearing their uninspired [[cover version|covers]] of current chart hits, club owners were reluctant to pay them, and soon after their arrival in Paris, thieves stole their equipment.{{sfn|Manning|2006|p=44}} While in France, Gilmour contributed—as a session musician—lead vocals to two songs on the soundtrack of the film ''[[Two Weeks in September]]'', starring [[Brigitte Bardot]].&lt;ref name="WH" /&gt; In May, Gilmour briefly returned to London in search of new equipment. During his stay, he watched Pink Floyd record "[[See Emily Play]]" and was shocked to find that Barrett, who was beginning to suffer mental health problems, did not seem to recognise him.{{sfn|Manning|2006|p=38}} When Bullitt returned to England later that year, they were so impoverished that their tour bus was completely empty of petrol and they had to push it off the [[ferry]] onto the landing.{{sfn|Manning|2006|p=44}}

==Pink Floyd==
{{Main|Pink Floyd}}
In late December 1967, Pink Floyd drummer [[Nick Mason]] approached Gilmour and asked him if he would be interested in joining the band to cover for the increasingly erratic Barrett. Gilmour accepted; they initially intended to continue with Barrett as a non-performing songwriter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=109–111}}: (primary source); {{harvnb|Povey|2008|p=47}}: (secondary source).&lt;/ref&gt; One of the group's business partners, [[Peter Jenner]], said: "The idea was that Dave would&amp;nbsp;... cover for Barrett's eccentricities and when that got to be not workable, Syd was just going to write. Just to try to keep him involved."{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|p=107}} By March 1968, working with Barrett had become too difficult; he agreed to leave the band and the others committed to moving on without him.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp= 112}}

After Barrett's departure, Gilmour sang much of Pink Floyd's lead vocals; Waters and keyboardist [[Richard Wright (musician)|Richard Wright]] also occasionally sang lead. After the successes of ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' and ''[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]]'', Waters took greater control of the band, writing and singing lead on most of ''[[Animals (Pink Floyd album)|Animals]]'' and ''[[The Wall]]''. Wright was fired during the sessions for ''The Wall;'' the relationship between Gilmour and Waters deteriorated during the making of the [[Pink Floyd – The Wall|eponymous film]], and during recording sessions for ''[[The Final Cut (album)|The Final Cut]]''. The final Pink Floyd performance of ''The Wall'' took place on 17 June 1981, at Earl's Court, London;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/pink-floyd-final-concert-roger-waters/|title=The Day Pink Floyd Played Their Final Concert With Roger Waters|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was Pink Floyd's last appearance with Waters for almost 25 years.{{sfn|Povey|Russell|1997|p=185}}

[[File:David Gilmour and stratocaster.jpg|thumb|Gilmour performing with [[Pink Floyd]] in the mid-1970s]]By the late 1970s, Gilmour had begun to think that his musical talents were being underused by Pink Floyd. In 1978 he channelled his ideas into his first solo album, ''[[David Gilmour (album)|David Gilmour]]'', which showcased his guitar playing and songwriting. Music written during the finishing stages of the album, but too late to be used, was incorporated into a song by Waters, which became "[[Comfortably Numb]]", included on ''The Wall''.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp=221–222}} 

The negative atmosphere surrounding the creation of ''The Wall'' album and subsequent film, compounded by ''The Final Cut''{{'}}s virtually being a Roger Waters solo album, led Gilmour to produce his second solo album, ''[[About Face (album)|About Face]]'', in 1984.&lt;ref name="Mabbett-1"&gt;{{cite book| edition = Updated| publisher=Omnibus| isbn = 0-7119-4109-2| last = Miles| first = Barry|author2=Andy Mabbett| title = Pink Floyd the visual documentary| location = London| year = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used it to express his feelings about a range of topics, from the murder of [[John Lennon]]&lt;ref name="Mabbett-1" /&gt; to his relationship with Waters. Gilmour toured Europe and the US along with support act the [[Television Personalities]], who were dropped from the line-up after Dan Treacy  revealed [[Syd Barrett]]'s address on stage.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|p=123}} Mason also made a guest appearance on the UK leg of the tour, which despite some cancellations eventually turned a profit.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=304}} When he returned from touring, Gilmour played guitar with a range of artists, and also produced [[the Dream Academy]], who had a US top ten hit with "[[Life in a Northern Town]]" in 1986.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=312}}

In 1985, Waters declared that Pink Floyd were "a spent force creatively".{{sfn|Povey|2008|pp=240–241, 246}} Gilmour and Mason responded with a press release stating that Waters had quit the band and they intended to continue without him.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=240}} Gilmour assumed full control of the group and produced ''[[A Momentary Lapse of Reason]]'' in 1987, with some contributions from Mason and Richard Wright.&lt;ref name="Mabbett-1" /&gt; Wright officially rejoined the band after the release of the album for a lengthy world tour and helped create 1994's ''[[The Division Bell]]''.&lt;ref name="Mabbett-1" /&gt; Gilmour explained: "I had a number of problems with the direction of the band in our recent past, before Roger left. I thought the songs were very wordy and that, because the specific meanings of those words were so important, the music became a mere vehicle for lyrics, and not a very inspiring one. ''Dark Side of the Moon'' and ''Wish You Were Here'' were so successful not just because of Roger's contributions, but also because there was a better balance between the music and the lyrics than there has been in more recent albums. That's what I'm trying to do with ''A Momentary Lapse of Reason''; more focus on the music, restore the balance." In 1986, Gilmour purchased the houseboat ''[[Astoria (recording studio)|Astoria]]'', moored it on the [[River Thames]] near Hampton Court and transformed it into a recording studio.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=318}} The majority of the two Pink Floyd albums released about this time, as well as Gilmour's 2006 solo album ''[[On an Island]]'', were recorded there.&lt;ref name="Mabbett-2"&gt;{{cite book| publisher=Omnibus,| isbn = 978-1-84938-370-7| last = Mabbett

On 2 July 2005, Gilmour played with Pink Floyd—including Roger Waters—at [[Live 8]]. The performance caused a temporary sales increase of Pink Floyd's album ''[[Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd]]''.&lt;ref name=giveback&gt;{{cite web|title=Pink Floyd gives back|url=http://www.soulshine.ca/news/newsarticle.php?nid=2241|accessdate=2 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilmour donated all of his profits to charities that reflect the goals of Live 8, saying: "Though the main objective has been to raise consciousness and put pressure on the [[G8]] leaders, I will not profit from the concert. This is money that should be used to save lives."&lt;ref name=giveback /&gt; He called upon all artists experiencing a surge in sales from Live 8 performances to donate the extra revenue to Live 8 fundraising. After the concert, Pink Floyd turned down an offer to tour the US for £150&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=askmen&gt;{{cite web|title=Pink Floyd offered millions to tour|url=http://www.askmen.com/celebs/entertainment-news/pink/pink-floyd-offered-millions-to-tour.html|accessdate=2 December 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219091320/http://www.askmen.com/celebs/entertainment-news/pink/pink-floyd-offered-millions-to-tour.html|archivedate=19 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Gilmour said that Pink Floyd would most likely never tour or write material again. He said: "I think enough is enough. I am 60 years old. I don't have the will to work as much any more. Pink Floyd was an important part in my life, I have had a wonderful time, but it's over. For me it's much less complicated to work alone."&lt;ref name=repubblica&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2006/b/sezioni/spettacoli_e_cultura/gilmo/gilmo/gilmo.html |title=Il requiem di David Gilmour "I Pink Floyd? Sono finiti" |work=la Repubblica |date=3 February 2006 |accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In December 2006, Gilmour released a tribute to Syd Barrett, who had died on 7 July of that year, in the form of his own version of Pink Floyd's first single "[[Arnold Layne]]".{{sfn|Mabbett|2010|pp=140–141}} Recorded live at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]], the single featured versions of the song performed by Richard Wright and guest artist [[David Bowie]].{{sfn|Mabbett|2010|pp=140–141}} The single peaked on the UK Top 20 singles chart at number nineteen.&lt;ref name="acharts"&gt;{{cite web|title=Arnold Layne chart position|url=http://acharts.us/song/11777|accessdate=4 December 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65VEo3tEA?url=http://acharts.us/song/11777|archivedate=16 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since their Live 8 appearance in 2005, Gilmour has repeatedly said that there will be no Pink Floyd reunion.

== Roy Harper ==

Gilmour has a long-standing association with [[Roy Harper (singer)|Roy Harper]], who was for a time managed by Pink Floyd's former managers [[Blackhill Enterprises]], recorded for the same label, [[Harvest Records]], and who appeared on the same bill as Pink Floyd at 1968's [[Midsummer High Weekend]] free concert in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]].&lt;ref name="Mabbett-1" /&gt; Harper sang "[[Have a Cigar]]" on Pink Floyd's 1975 ''[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]]'' album, and sang the song with them at that year's [[Knebworth Festival]].&lt;ref name="Mabbett-1" /&gt; Gilmour played on Harper's albums ''[[HQ (album)|HQ]]'' (1975), ''[[The Unknown Soldier (album)|The Unknown Soldier]]'' (1980) and ''[[Once (Roy Harper album)|Once]]'' (1990).&lt;ref name="Mabbett-1" /&gt;  Five of the ten songs on the second of these were co-compositions, one of which, "Short and Sweet", was first recorded for Gilmour's first solo album.&lt;ref name="Mabbett-1" /&gt; Another, "You", also features Kate Bush, as does the title track on ''Once''.&lt;ref name="Mabbett-1" /&gt; In April 1984, Harper made surprise guest appearance at Gilmour's [[Hammersmith Odeon]] gig to sing "Short and Sweet".&lt;ref name="Mabbett-1" /&gt; This was included in Gilmour's ''Live 1984'' concert film. Harper also provided backing vocals on Gilmour's ''About Face'' album.&lt;ref name="Mabbett-1" /&gt;

While writing for ''About Face'', Gilmour had a tune, and asked [[Pete Townshend]] of [[The Who]] to supply lyrics. This Townshend did, but Gilmour rejected them (Townshend would use both tune and lyrics, as ""White City Fighting", on his 1985 ''[[White City: A Novel]]'' album, which features Gilmour on that track, and on ''[[Give Blood (song)|Give Blood]]''). Gilmour then asked Harper for lyrics, but rejected those also, deciding not to use the tune on the album after all. Eventually Harper used his version, "Hope", which has a markedly slower tempo, on his 1985 album with [[Jimmy Page]], called ''[[Whatever Happened to Jugula?]]''.&lt;ref name="Mabbett-1" /&gt;

== Kate Bush ==

Gilmour is credited for bringing songwriter [[Kate Bush]] to public attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/5882-top-100-albums-of-the-1980s/|title=Top 100 Albums of the 1980s {{!}} Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; While she was at school, Gilmour received a copy of her demo tape from Ricky Hopper, a mutual friend of Gilmour and the Bush family. Impressed, Gilmour helped the sixteen-year-old Bush get a more professional demo tape recorded that would be more saleable to the record companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/node/149907 |title=The Wow Factor |magazine=[[New Statesman]] |date=7 February 2005 |last=Cowley |first=Jason}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three tracks were recorded and paid for by Gilmour.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, 8 February 1990, pp&amp;nbsp;21–2: "The Sensual Woman" by Sheila Rogers.&lt;/ref&gt; The tape was produced by Gilmour's friend [[Andrew Powell]], who went on to produce Bush's first two albums, and sound engineer [[Geoff Emerick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Rightful Heir? |work=[[Q (magazine)|Q]] |number=48 |date=September 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilmour arranged for [[EMI]] executive Terry Slater to hear the tape,&lt;ref name="Soundscape"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kruse|first=Holly|date=November 2000|title=Kate Bush: Enigmatic chanteuse as pop pioneer|url=http://www.icce.rug.nl/~soundscapes/DATABASES/TRA/Kate_Bush.shtml|journal=Soundscapes.info, Online Journal on Media Culture|volume=3|issn=1567-7745}}, Originally published in {{cite journal|year=1988|title=Tracking: Popular Music Studies|volume=1|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was impressed and signed her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emi-premier.co.uk/loader.html |title=Kate Bush |publisher=[[EMI]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226142058/http://www.emi-premier.co.uk/loader.html |archivedate=26 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilmour is credited as executive producer on two tracks on Bush's debut album ''[[The Kick Inside]]'', including her second single "[[The Man with the Child in His Eyes]]".&lt;ref name="Mabbett-1" /&gt; He performs backing vocals on "Pull Out the Pin", on her fourth album, ''[[The Dreaming (album)|The Dreaming]]'',&lt;ref name="Mabbett-1" /&gt; and plays guitar on "[[Love and Anger (song)|Love and Anger]]" and "Rocket's Tail" on her sixth, ''[[The Sensual World]]''.&lt;ref name="Mabbett-1" /&gt;

In March 1987, Bush, notorious for the rarity of her live performances, sang "[[Running Up That Hill]]" at [[The Secret Policeman's Balls|The Secret Policeman's Third Ball]] with Gilmour on guitar.&lt;ref name="Mabbett-1" /&gt;  A three DVD set of [[The Secret Policeman's Balls]] benefit concerts that includes their performance was released in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homemediamagazine.com/tv-dvd/unveiling-britains-secret-14017 |title=Unveiling Britain's 'Secret' |publisher=[[Home Media Magazine]] |date=5 December 2008 |author=John Latchem |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209075344/http://homemediamagazine.com/tv-dvd/unveiling-britains-secret-14017 |archivedate=9 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, she performed "[[Comfortably Numb]]", singing the part of the doctor, at Gilmour's concert at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] in London.

==Solo work==
[[File:David gilmour brussels 1984.jpg|thumb|Gilmour performing live in [[Brussels]], Belgium on his ''[[About Face (album)|About Face]]'' tour, 1984]]Gilmour has recorded four solo studio albums, all four of which have charted in the US Top 40: his self-titled solo debut peaked at No. 29 in 1978, ''About Face'' peaked at No. 32 in 1984, ''On an Island'' peaked at No. 6 in 2006, and ''Rattle That Lock'' peaked at No. 5 in 2015. His live albums ''Live in Gdansk'' (2008) and ''Live at Pompeii'' (2017) peaked at number 26 and number 45, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/David-Gilmour/chart-history/billboard-200 |title=David Gilmour Chart History |publisher=Billboard |access-date=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking time off from Pink Floyd's schedule, Gilmour also took up various roles as a record producer, [[sideman]] and sound engineer for acts including&lt;ref name="Mabbett-1" /&gt; former bandmate Syd Barrett, Unicorn, [[Paul McCartney]], [[Arcadia (band)|Arcadia]], [[Berlin (band)|Berlin]], [[John Martyn]], [[Grace Jones]], [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], [[Elton John]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[B.B.

In 1985, Gilmour played on [[Bryan Ferry]]'s sixth album ''[[Boys and Girls (album)|Boys and Girls]]'', as well as the song "Is Your Love Strong Enough" for the US release of the [[Ridley Scott]]–[[Tom Cruise]] film ''[[Legend (1985 film)|Legend]]''. A music video for the latter was created, incorporating Ferry and Gilmour into footage from the film&lt;ref name="Mabbett-1" /&gt; (released as a bonus on the 2002 "Ultimate Edition" DVD release). Later that year, Gilmour played with Ferry at the London [[Live Aid#London Wembley Stadium|Live Aid]] concert;&lt;ref name="Mabbett-1" /&gt; his first collaboration with Ferry's keyboardist [[Jon Carin]], later to tour with Pink Floyd.

===2000s===
In 2001 and 2002, Gilmour performed a total of six acoustic solo concerts in London and Paris, along with a small band and choir, which was documented on the ''[[David Gilmour in Concert|In Concert]]'' release.{{sfn|Povey|2008|pp=306, 314–315}} On 24 September 2004, he performed a three-song set at [[the Strat Pack]] concert at London's [[Wembley Arena]], marking the 50th anniversary of the [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] [[Fender Stratocaster|Stratocaster]] guitar.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=315}}

More shows took place in Europe from July to August in 2006.{{sfn|Povey|2008|pp=306–310}} In a press release to promote the tour, Gilmour stated: "I'm rather hoping that with this tour announcement, people will believe me when I say, honestly, this is the only band I plan to tour with!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gilmour Unveils North American Tour Dates|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/60305/gilmour-unveils-north-american-tour-dates|website=Billboard.com|accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 April 2006, ''On an Island'' was certified [[music recording sales certification|platinum]] in Canada, with sales of over 100,000 copies.

The concert was part of the 'Hidden Gigs' campaign against hidden homelessness, which is organised by [[Crisis (charity)|Crisis]], a UK-based national charity campaigning against homelessness. In the concert he collaborated with the [[Mali]]an musicians [[Amadou &amp; Mariam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brain-damage.co.uk/concerts/amadou-mariam-with-david-gilmour-union-chapel-london-may-25.html |title=Pink Floyd news resource |publisher=Brain Damage |date=27 May 2009 |accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 July 2009, he joined his friend [[Jeff Beck]] onstage at the Royal Albert Hall. Gilmour and Beck traded solos on "Jerusalem" and closed the show with "[[Hi Ho Silver Lining]]". In August 2009, he released an online single, "Chicago&amp;nbsp;– Change the World", on which he sang and played guitar, bass and keyboards, to promote awareness of the plight of [[Gary McKinnon]]. A re-titled cover of the [[Graham Nash]] song "[[Chicago (Graham Nash song)|Chicago]]", it featured [[Chrissie Hynde]] and [[Bob Geldof]], plus McKinnon himself.

==Musical style==
Gilmour is primarily regarded as a [[lead guitarist]]. His style is characterised by [[blues]]-influenced phrasing, expressive note bends, and sustain. In 2006, Gilmour said of his playing: "[My] fingers make a distinctive sound... [they] aren't very fast, but I think I am instantly recognisable".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/classic-guitar-interview-david-gilmour-2006-537288|title=Classic guitar interview: David Gilmour, 2006|website=Musicradar.com|accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said his melodic sense was influenced by artists such as [[Hank Marvin]] and [[the Shadows]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2006, ''[[Guitar World]]'' writer Jimmy Brown described Gilmour's playing as "characterised by simple, huge-sounding riffs; gutsy, well-paced solos; and rich, ambient chordal textures". ''Rolling Stone'' critic Alan di Perna praised Gilmour's guitar work as an integral element of Pink Floyd's sound. Di Perna described him as the most important guitarist of the 1970s, and described him as "the missing link between Hendrix and [[Eddie Van Halen|Van Halen]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-20111123/david-gilmour-20111122|title=100 Greatest Guitarists: David Gilmour|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilmour credits guitarists such as [[Pete Seeger]], [[Lead Belly]], [[Jeff Beck]], [[Eric Clapton]], and [[Jimi Hendrix]] as early influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/blog/the-view-from-here/interview-david-gilmour-99501/4|title=An interview with David Gilmour - Page 4 of 8 - Uncut|date=2017-03-06|work=Uncut|access-date=2018-05-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in his career with Pink Floyd, Gilmour played a multitude of [[Fender Stratocaster]]s. He recorded one of his guitar solos, for "[[Another Brick in the Wall]], Part 2", in one take using no editing or mixing using a 1955 [[Gibson Les Paul]] Gold Top guitar equipped with [[P-90]] pick-ups.{{sfn|Fitch|Mahon|2006|pp=75–76}} 

Although mainly known for his guitar work, Gilmour is also a multi-instrumentalist. He played bass on some Pink Floyd tracks, and plays [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]], synthesiser, [[banjo]], lap steel, mandolin, harmonica, drums, and saxophone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidgilmourtour.com/band.html|work=David Gilmour Tour Band.com|title=David Gilmour|accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilmour is an experienced pilot and aviation enthusiast. Under the aegis of his company, [[Intrepid Aviation]],&lt;ref name="Mabbett-1" /&gt; he had amassed a collection of historical aircraft. He later decided to sell the company, which he had started as a hobby, feeling that it was becoming too commercial for him to handle. In a BBC interview, he stated:
{{quote|Intrepid Aviation was a way for me to make my hobby pay for itself a little bit, but gradually over a few years Intrepid Aviation became a business because you have to be businesslike about it.

==Guitars==
===The 0001 Strat===
[[File:Pink Floyd Their Mortal Remains - 2017-10-13 - Andy Mabbett - 43.jpg|thumb|upright|Gilmour's "Black Strat", a Fender Stratocaster, on display at the [[Pink Floyd: Their Mortal Remains]] exhibition. Considered Gilmour's primary guitar, the instrument was purchased in New York in 1970 and used on all Pink Floyd albums and shows until the mid 1980s, and at the band's [[Live 8]] reunion.&lt;ref name=TMR&gt;''[[Pink Floyd: Their Mortal Remains]]'' exhibition label&lt;/ref&gt;]]The 0001 Strat is a [[Fender Stratocaster]] [[electric guitar]], with a white body, maple neck, three-way pick up selector and an unusual gold colour scratch plate and hardware, owned by David Gilmour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2SJDBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA97|title=Star Guitars|work=|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/fender-stratocaster-celebrates-its-60th-anniversary-1573851|title=The Fender Stratocaster Celebrates Its 60th Anniversary|author=Dennis Lynch|date=19 April 2014|work=International Business Times|accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilmourish" /&gt; He bought it from guitar technician Phil Taylor, who had purchased it from [[Seymour Duncan]].&lt;ref name="Spare Bricks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sparebricks.fika.org/sbzine01/sections/ggg.html |title=Gilmour: Guitars &amp; Gear |work=Sparebricks.fika.org |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[guitar]] is one of the most notable in his collection as it has the 0001 serial number. Gilmour used the guitar in the 2004 [[The Strat Pack|Strat Pack]] show that commemorated the 50th anniversary of the Stratocaster at [[Wembley Arena]] along with one of his Candy Apple Red Stratocasters (famous for their appearances with Gilmour from 1987 to 2004). It is not the first Fender Stratocaster ever made as [[prototype]]s had already been constructed before this one. The origin of the guitar is unknown, and isn't clear whether it is the real 0001 Strat because the neck (which has the 0001 serial number on it) could have been taken off the original.&lt;ref name="Gilmourish"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gilmourish.com/?page_id=259 |title=The #0001 Stratocaster |work=Gilmourish.com |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model was used as a spare and for slide guitar in subsequent years.

===Other electric guitars===

Along with the Fender models, Gilmour has also used a [[Gibson Les Paul]] goldtop model with P-90 pick-ups during recording sessions for ''The Wall'' and ''A Momentary Lapse of Reason''.{{sfn|Fitch|2005|pp=428, 431}} It was used for the guitar solo on "Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2".

Gilmour also plays a [[Gretsch]] Duo-Jet, a [[Gretsch White Falcon]], and a "White Penguin". He played a Bill Lewis 24-fret guitar during the ''[[Meddle]]'' and ''Dark Side of the Moon'' recording sessions, and a [[Steinberger]] GL model which was his main guitar during ''A Momentary Lapse of Reason'' recording sessions.{{sfn|Fitch|2005|pp=420: Bill Lewis 24-fret guitar, 431: [[Steinberger]] GL model}}

===Acoustics===
Gilmour has used many acoustic guitars, including a [[Gibson Chet Atkins SST|Gibson Chet Atkins]] classical model, and a [[Gibson J-200]] Celebrity acoustic guitar.{{sfn|Fitch|2005|p=434}} Gilmour used several [[Ovation Guitar Company|Ovation]] models including a Custom Legend 1619-4, and a Custom Legend 1613-4 nylon string guitar, both during ''The Wall'' recording sessions.{{sfn|Fitch|Mahon|2006|p=268}} [[C. F. Martin &amp; Company|Martin]] models used include a D-35, and a D12-28 12-string.{{sfn|Fitch|Mahon|2006|p=268}} Gilmour's large acoustic collection also includes many models from [[Taylor Guitars|Taylor]], [[Takamine guitars|Takamine]], and [[Guild Guitar Company|Guild]].

===Steel guitar===

Throughout his recording career Gilmour has added a different element to his guitar style with his use of [[steel guitar]]s. A pair of Jedson steel guitars, as well as a Fender 1000 pedal steel, were used frequently in the early 1970s. Originally purchased from a pawn shop while Gilmour was in [[Seattle]] in 1970, the Jedson was used during recording of "[[One of These Days (instrumental)|One of These Days]]" from ''Meddle'' and "[[Breathe (Pink Floyd song)|Breathe]]" and "[[The Great Gig in the Sky]]" from ''Dark Side of the Moon''.{{sfn|Fitch|2005|p=424}} Gilmour also owns a [[Fender Deluxe Reverb|Fender Deluxe]] [[lap steel guitar|lap steel]], which he used during ''The Division Bell'' tour in 1994.{{sfn|Fitch|2005|p=434}} Gilmour also owns a Champ lap steel model. Along with the Fender steel models Gilmour has also used: a Gibson EH150, and two Jedson models: one red (1977-tuned D-G-D-G-B-E for "[[Shine On You Crazy Diamond]], Parts 6–9", 1987–2006: Tuned E-B-E-G-B-E for "[[High Hopes (Pink Floyd song)|High Hopes]]") and one blonde. He also uses a ZB steel model.{{sfn|Fitch|Mahon|2006|p=268}} Gilmour played pedal steel guitar on the album ''Blue Pine Trees'' by Unicorn.

===Bass guitars===
Gilmour has played the bass guitar both in the studio and onstage, and has played many bass models including: an Ovation Magnum, a [[Fender Bass VI]], [[Fender Precision Bass|Fender Precision]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pink Floyd – David Gilmour's Guitar Gear Rig and Equipment |url=http://www.uberproaudio.com/who-plays-what/160-pink-floyd-david-gilmours-guitar-gear-rig-and-equipment |work=ÜberProAudio |accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jazz bass models and a [[Charvel]] fretless (all used during ''The Wall'' recording sessions). During the 1991 [[Amnesty International]] concert Gilmour used a [[Music Man (company)|Music Man]] Fretless Stingray bass while conducting the house band and again during [[Spinal Tap (band)|Spinal Tap]]'s performance of "Big Bottom".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://equipboard.com/pros/david-gilmour|title=David Gilmour|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fender Black Strat Signature Stratocaster===
In November 2006, [[Fender Custom Shop]] announced two reproductions of Gilmour's "Black" Strat for release on 22 September 2008. Phil Taylor, Gilmour's guitar tech, supervised this release and has written a book on the history of this guitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theblackstrat.com/The_Black_Strat-home...html |title=The Black Strat |work=Theblackstrat.com |accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release date was chosen to coincide with the release of Gilmour's ''[[Live in Gdańsk]]'' album.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.edroman.com/guitars/fender/fender_artist/david_gilmour.html|title=David Gilmour|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both guitars are based on extensive measurements of the original instrument, each featuring varying degrees of wear. The most expensive is the David Gilmour Relic Stratocaster which features the closest copy of wear on the original guitar. A pristine copy of the guitar is also made, the David Gilmour NOS Stratocaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.guitarworld.com/fender_david_gilmour_signature_series_stratocaster|title=Fender David Gilmour Signature Series Stratocaster|date=2 February 2009|accessdate=29 October 2015|work=[[Guitar World]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

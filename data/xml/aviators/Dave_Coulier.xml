'''David Alan Coulier''' (born September 21, 1959)&lt;ref name=tvg&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/dave-coulier/bio/146273 | publisher = [[TV Guide|TVGuide.com]] | title= Dave Coulier |accessdate= June 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American actor, voice actor, stand-up comedian, impressionist and television host. He is well known for playing [[Joey Gladstone]] on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Full House]]'' and for voicing [[Peter Venkman]] on the cartoon adaptation of ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' and the infant incarnations of [[Animal]] and [[Bunsen]] on ''[[Muppet Babies]]''.

==Early life==
David Alan Coulier, formerly Couwlier, was born to David Alan Couwlier and Arlen Couwlier in [[St. Clair Shores, Michigan]], on September 21, 1959.&lt;ref name=tvg /&gt;  His mother's side of the family is from [[Bathurst, New Brunswick|Bathurst]], [[New Brunswick]], Canada, and his paternal grandmother was a [[Jewish]] immigrant from Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|last=Pollak |first=Kevin |interviewer=Kevin Pollak |title=Kevin Pollak Chat Show |last2=Coulier |first2=Dave |url=http://www.kevinpollakschatshow.com/archive/?cat=217 |date=January 10, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He got his start in [[stand-up comedy]] in high school by impersonating his principal and other staff over his high school's PA system. He graduated in 1977 from [[Notre Dame High School (Harper Woods, Michigan)|Notre Dame High School]] in [[Harper Woods, Michigan]], where he was a member of the varsity [[ice hockey]] team, playing defense alongside future NHL player [[John Blum]]. He briefly attended the [[University of Michigan]] but dropped out after his freshman year to pursue comedy.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Career==
Coulier met future ''[[Full House]]'' co-star [[Bob Saget]] through the [[Los Angeles]] comedy circuit. The two became good friends and Coulier briefly lived with Saget and his then-wife Sherri on their couch in the early 1980s as he struggled to get his career started.

He was initially cast as a player for ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' for the 1986 season. However, right before the season started, casting changes were made and he was left off the show. It was said that many of the producers felt he was too similar in humor style to [[Dana Carvey]], who was also joining the show in 1986, and that was why the change was made.

Coulier has done extensive voice work for shows including ''[[Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo (1979 TV series)|Scooby and Scrappy-Doo]]'', ''[[The Real Ghostbusters]],'' ''[[Slimer! and the Real Ghostbusters]]'' (taking over the character of [[Peter Venkman]] after [[Lorenzo Music]]'s departure from the role), ''[[Extreme Ghostbusters]]'', ''[[Muppet Babies]] ''after [[Howie Mandel]] left (Baby [[Dr. Teeth and The Electric Mayhem#Animal|Animal]], Baby [[Bunsen Honeydew|Bunsen]], [[Bean Bunny]], and Uncle [[Statler and Waldorf]], and a pre-teen [[Janice (muppet)|Janice]] for one episode), ''[[The Jetsons]]'', ''[[Rude Dog|Rude Dog and the Dweebs]]'', and ''[[Detention (TV series)|Detention]]''. From 1984 to 1985, he was also the host of a comedy series on [[Nickelodeon]] known as ''[[Out of Control (TV series)|Out of Control]]''.

Coulier is known for playing [[Joey Gladstone]] on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''Full House''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/postcrescent/access/1876067551.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Oct+07%2C+2009&amp;author=Cheryl+Anderson&amp;pub=The+Post+-+Crescent&amp;desc=Standup+comedian+Dave+Coulier+best+known+as+Uncle+Joey+on+ABC's+%22Full+House%22+brings+comic+act+to+Comedy+Quarter+in+Neenah&amp;pqatl=google|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724231000/http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/postcrescent/access/1876067551.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Oct+07%2C+2009&amp;author=Cheryl+Anderson&amp;pub=The+Post+-+Crescent&amp;desc=Standup+comedian+Dave+Coulier+best+known+as+Uncle+Joey+on+ABC's+%22Full+House%22+brings+comic+act+to+Comedy+Quarter+in+Neenah&amp;pqatl=google|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 24, 2012|title=Coulier on ABC's Full House|publisher=pqasb.pqarchiver.com|accessdate=December 2, 2010|first=Cheryl|last=Anderson|date=October 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stayed on the show from 1987 until its cancellation in 1995. He was famous for doing voices and impersonations. In addition to ''Full House'', Coulier appeared on ''[[George and Leo]]'' and ''[[Nick Freno: Licensed Teacher]]''. He has also hosted ''[[America's Funniest People]]'' (first with [[Arleen Sorkin]] and later with [[Tawny Kitaen]]) and ''Opportunity Knocks''. Additionally, he was also a voice actor in ''[[Yogi Bear and the Magical Flight of the Spruce Goose]]'' and has voiced [[Felix the Cat]] on a few occasions. He also put out a solo album called ''Cut It Out'', a self-proclaimed tribute to "[[Sleeveless shirt|tank tops]] and short shorts."

In addition to his voice work, Coulier has also taken a few acting parts appearing in the [[Disney Channel Original Movie]]'s ''[[The Thirteenth Year]]'' and ''[[The Even Stevens Movie]]'' (where he had a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] as a [[reality show]] host), as well as the [[Nickelodeon]] original movie ''[[Shredderman Rules]]'' and he wrote and starred in an unaired pilot for FX called ''Whispers and Balls''.

He also founded his own children's entertainment company [[F3 Entertainment]], in 2000. In 2003, Coulier appeared on season three of ''[[The Surreal Life]]''. In 2006, he appeared on the TV reality show ''[[Skating with Celebrities]]'' on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]], where he was paired with Olympic medalist [[Nancy Kerrigan]]. They were eliminated in episode four.

Currently, he is a member of ''Duck's Breath Mystery Theater'' touring [[comedy]] troupe (which he claims is clean comedy but "not quite as creepy" as ''Full House'') as well as host of the series ''Animal Kidding''. His work on ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' is probably his most "adult" to date, voicing [[off-color]] situations, like [[Popeye]] savagely beating [[J. Wellington Wimpy|Wimpy]] over a debt.

On June 2, 2008, [[Chikara (professional wrestling)|Chikara]], [[professional wrestling promotion]] based in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], announced that Coulier was elected by the Chikara Board of Directors as the new commissioner of the company, a position that he held for two years until the next election (which took place on May 25, 2010). Coulier is the successor to former Commissioner and fellow ''Full House'' cast member Bob Saget.

In 2009, Coulier provided the voice for Bob McKenzie on the [[Television in Canada|Canadian]] animated series ''[[Bob &amp; Doug (2009 TV series)|Bob &amp; Doug]]'', based on the [[Second City Television|SCTV]] characters [[Bob and Doug McKenzie]]. Coulier became the first person other than [[Rick Moranis]] to portray the character, as Moranis (who serves as [[executive producer]]) was not interested in resuming the part. Coulier says he understands that longtime fans might be skeptical of his take on the role, but he could not help jumping at the chance to portray one of his favorite comic characters. "It's huge shoes to fill, stepping into Rick Moranis' shoes. It's such an established, great character and I guess the only thing I have going for me is that it kind of sounds alike and that half of my family is from Canada." His mother's family is from [[Bathurst, New Brunswick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beta.mytelus.com/telusen/portal/NewsChannel.aspx?CatID=Entertainment&amp;ArticleID=news/capfeed/entertainment/e041659A.xml |title=TELUS, news, headlines, stories, breaking, entertainment, music, movies |publisher=Beta.mytelus.com |accessdate=June 3, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coulier continued to make regular television appearances as the host of shows such as ''[[America's Funniest People]]'' and ''[[America's Most Talented Kid]]''. He continues to tour the U.S. and Canada as a stand-up comedian.

Coulier currently reprises his role as Joey Gladstone for the ''Full House'' spin-off ''[[Fuller House (TV series)|Fuller House]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Whitney |last=Friedlander |url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/dave-coulier-full-house-netflix-1201489786/|title='Full House' Reboot: Dave Coulier Joins ‘Fuller House’ on Netflix|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=May 7, 2015|accessdate=August 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comedic style===
{{BLP unsourced section|date=October 2014}}
Coulier's stand-up routine is centered on his ability to mimic celebrities and cartoon characters, a talent that has given him a second career in voice acting. Many of Coulier's bits involve putting well-known characters into unexpected situations. Coulier has also been known to include harmonica playing in his act. Coulier's material is largely family-friendly, a position he has extended to his youth-oriented comedy website, ''cleanguys.TV''.

In April 2008, Coulier was featured on the Clean Guys of Comedy Tour, a family-friendly comedy group. The tour includes [[Ryan Hamilton (comedian)|Ryan Hamilton]] from ''[[Last Comic Standing]]'' and Kivi Rogers.

==Personal life==
In the early 1990s, Coulier was married for two years to [[Jayne Modean]]. They have one son, named Luc Coulier, born in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Chiu |first=Meoldy |url=http://www.people.com/article/dave-coulier-wedding-inside-melissa-bring-john-stamos |title=Inside Dave Coulier and Melissa Bring's Montana Wedding |work=People |date=July 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having divorced, he started dating [[Alanis Morissette]], but they broke up shortly before she recorded her album ''[[Jagged Little Pill]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2010/06/07/alanis-morissette-married.html | work=CBC News | title=Alanis Morissette marries rapper boyfriend | date=June 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is widely believed to be the subject of Morissette's song "[[You Oughta Know]]."  In 2005, Coulier began dating photographer and producer Melissa Bring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/article/dave-coulier-engaged-full-house-melissa-bring |title=Full House's Dave Coulier Is Engaged to Melissa Bring |work=People |date=June 11, 2014|accessdate=July 2, 2014|first1=Andrea|last1=Billups|first2=Aili|last2=Nahas}}&lt;/ref&gt; They married on July 2, 2014, in Montana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/article/dave-coulier-married-melissa-bring-full-house-wedding|title=Dave Coulier of Full House Is Married!|work=People |date=July 2, 2014|accessdate=July 2, 2014|first1=K.C.|last1=Blumm|first2=Rennie|last2=Dyball}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coulier is a private pilot who owns and flies a [[Beechcraft Bonanza|B35 Bonanza]]. His first general aviation flight was at the age of five in Michigan. He earned his pilot's license at the same airport later in 1979 and is now [[Instrument Rating in the United States|instrument rated]].  In 2012, he did more flight training in a [[Cirrus SR20]] to "keep current".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AOPA Summit - 10 Questions for Dave Coulier|url=http://www.aopa.org/summit/news/2012/121012dave-coulier.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is part of the Hat in the Ring Society to support the [[Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association|AOPA foundation]], an organization that promotes safe flying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Uncle Joey is a pilot|url=http://www.aopa.org/aircraft/articles/2012/120320uncle-joey-is-a-pilot.html|publisher=Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association|accessdate=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coulier is an [[ice hockey]] fan and participates in charity events with the [[Detroit Red Wings]]. He is also an avid fan of the [[Detroit Tigers]] and has played in a few celebrity softball games alongside [[Detroit Tigers|Tigers]] fan [[Tom Selleck]].&lt;ref name=QandA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ndpma.org/drupal/files/Coulier%20Q&amp;A%20with%20Borri.pdf |title=Q&amp;A: Detroit celebrity and Red Wings’ fan, Dave Coulier ’77 (NDHS) |format=PDF |accessdate=March 26, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314112557/http://www.ndpma.org/drupal/files/Coulier%20Q%26A%20with%20Borri.pdf |archivedate=March 14, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samuel Timothy "Tim" McGraw''' (born May 1, 1967) is an American [[country music|country]] singer and actor. McGraw began singing in a [[neotraditional country]] style, but starting with 1997's ''[[Everywhere (Tim McGraw album)|Everywhere]]'', he developed a more crossover-friendly, [[country pop]] sound, making him one of the first male Country singers of his generation to crossover to Pop.

McGraw has released fifteen studio albums (eleven for [[Curb Records]], three for [[Big Machine Records]] and one for [[Arista Nashville]]). 10 of those albums have reached number 1 on the [[Top Country Albums]] charts, with his 1994 breakthrough album ''[[Not a Moment Too Soon]]'' being the top country album of 1994. All of these albums have produced 65 singles, 25 of which have reached number 1 on the [[Hot Country Songs]] or [[Country Airplay]] charts. Three of these singles — "[[It's Your Love]]", "[[Just to See You Smile]]", and "[[Live Like You Were Dying (song)|Live Like You Were Dying]]" — were the top country songs of 1997, 1998, and 2004 according to [[Billboard Year-End|''Billboard'' Year-End]]. He has also won three [[Grammy Awards]], 14 [[Academy of Country Music]] awards, 11 [[Country Music Association]] (CMA) awards, 10 [[American Music Awards]], and three [[People's Choice Awards]]. His [[Soul2Soul II Tour]] with Faith Hill is one of the highest grossing tours in country music history, and one of the top 5 among all genres of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Tim McGraw | publisher = Curb Records | url =http://www.curb.com/artists/tim-mcgraw | accessdate =April 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has sold more than 75 million records worldwide, making him one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists of all time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theintell.com/entertainmentlife/20180606/concert-scene-mcgraw-and-hill-bring-star-power-to-hershey |title=Concert Scene: McGraw and Hill bring star power to Hershey |first=Marty |last=Franzen |work=[[The Intelligencer (Doylestown, Pennsylvania)|The Intelligencer]] |date=June 6, 2018 |accessdate=June 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McGraw has ventured into acting, with supporting roles in ''[[The Blind Side (film)|The Blind Side]]'' (with [[Sandra Bullock]]), ''[[Friday Night Lights (film)|Friday Night Lights]]'', ''[[The Kingdom (film)|The Kingdom]]'', ''[[Tomorrowland (film)|Tomorrowland]]'', and ''[[Four Christmases]]'' (with [[Vince Vaughn]] and [[Reese Witherspoon]]), and ''[[The Shack (2017 film)|The Shack]]'', and lead roles in ''[[Flicka]]'' (2006) and ''[[Country Strong]]'' (2010). He was a minority owner of the [[Arena Football League (1987&amp;ndash;2008)|Arena Football League]]'s [[Nashville Kats]].

In acknowledgement of his grandfather's [[Italian people|Italian]] heritage, McGraw was honored by the [[National Italian American Foundation]] (NIAF) in 2004, receiving the NIAF Special Achievement Award in Music during the Foundation's 29th Anniversary Gala.

He has been married to singer [[Faith Hill]] since 1996, and is a son of baseball player [[Tug McGraw]].

==Early life==
Samuel Timothy McGraw was born in [[Delhi, Louisiana]], the only child of Elizabeth "Betty" Ann D'Agostino, a waitress from [[Jacksonville, Florida]], and [[Tug McGraw|Frank Edwin "Tug" McGraw Jr.]], a [[pitcher]] for the minor league [[Jacksonville Suns]] and future star pitcher for the [[New York Mets]] and the [[Philadelphia Phillies]]. McGraw is of Italian and Irish descent on his mother's side, and of Scots-Irish, English, Scottish, Swiss, Dutch, Czech, and German descent on his father's side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nvdaily.com/news/2011/02/country-superstar-mcgraw-learns-of-his-belle-grove-roots.php|title=Country superstar McGraw learns of his Belle Grove roots|work=The Northern Virginia Daily|first=Amber|last=Marra|date=February 5, 2011|accessdate=March 3, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513160506/http://www.nvdaily.com/news/2011/02/country-superstar-mcgraw-learns-of-his-belle-grove-roots.php|archivedate=May 13, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="larryking" /&gt; In 1966, McGraw's mother lived in the same apartment building as his father, who was playing baseball for Jacksonville, while D'Agostino was a student at [[Terry Parker High School]].  When McGraw's teenage mother became pregnant, his grandparents sent D'Agostino to Louisiana to live with relatives.&lt;ref name=MOM&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/042304/woo_15421921.shtml|work=[[The Florida Times-Union]]|title=Tim's mom survives, has a new dream|location=Jacksonville|date=April 23, 2004|accessdate=March 3, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617224556/http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/042304/woo_15421921.shtml|archivedate=June 17, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through his father, McGraw has two half-brothers, Mark and Matthew, and a half-sister named Cari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Litsky|first1=Frank|title=Tug McGraw, 59, Is Dead; Star With Mets and Phillies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/06/sports/tug-mcgraw-59-is-dead-star-with-mets-and-phillies.html?mcubz=2|accessdate=June 30, 2017|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 6, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Start, LA, welcome sign IMG 0142.JPG|right|200px|thumb|[[Start, Louisiana]], welcome sign notes that McGraw once resided there.]]

Raised in the Louisiana towns of [[Start, Louisiana|Start]]&lt;ref name="allmusic"/&gt; and  [[Richland Parish, Louisiana|Richland Parish]], McGraw grew up believing his stepfather, Horace Smith, was his father and until he met his biological father, McGraw's last name was Smith.  At age 11, McGraw discovered his birth certificate while searching in his mother's closet to look for a picture for a school project.  Following the discovery, McGraw learned from his mother who his biological father was and she took him to meet the elder McGraw for the first time.&lt;ref name="larryking" /&gt; Tug McGraw denied the parentage for seven years until McGraw was 18 years old.  After that time, the two formed a relationship and remained close until the former baseball star's death in 2004.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

As a child, McGraw played competitive sports, including baseball, even before the knowledge of who his father was and his professional baseball career.&lt;ref name="larryking" /&gt; McGraw was also a member of the FFA in high school.  Following high school graduation, he attended [[University of Louisiana at Monroe|Northeast Louisiana University]] on a baseball scholarship and pledged as a member of [[Pi Kappa Alpha]] fraternity.&lt;ref name="allmusic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pike"&gt;{{cite web |title = What's different about Pike? | publisher = Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity, Kappa Psi Chapter | url =http://www.pomonapikes.com/ | accessdate =March 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/ulmwarhawks/docs/2013_bsb_guide?SPSID=90641&amp;SPID=10978&amp;DB_LANG=C&amp;DB_OEM_ID=19000 |title=History &amp; Records: All-Time Roster |work=2013 ULM Baseball Guide |publisher=[[Louisiana–Monroe Warhawks|ULM Warhawks Athletics]] |pages=74–76 |accessdate=November 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A knee injury sustained while playing baseball for the college prevented him from pursuing a professional career in sports.{{cn|date=February 2018}}  

During college, McGraw learned to play guitar, and would frequently perform and sing for money.  He has claimed his roommates often hid the guitar because he was so bad.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}  McGraw followed his mother when she returned to [[Jacksonville, Florida]] in 1987.  After the move, he attended [[Florida Community College at Jacksonville]] for one term, and occasionally sat in with local bands.&lt;ref name=MOM /&gt;  In 1989, on the day his hero [[Keith Whitley]] died,&lt;ref name="allmusic"/&gt; McGraw dropped out of college to head to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] and pursue a musical career.&lt;ref name="larryking" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/A2276057?q=Tim+McGraw&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=1&amp;_start=1#firsthit] {{dead link|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music career==
===1990s===
====''Tim McGraw''====
[[File:Tim McGraw HWoF Star.jpg|right|thumb|Tim McGraw's star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]]]
McGraw came to the attention of [[Curb Records]] in 1990. After cutting a demo single, McGraw gave a copy to his father. A man who was friends with Curb Records executives heard the demo while driving with Tug one day and recommended that Curb contact the young singer. Several weeks later, he was able to play his tape for Curb executives, after which they signed him to a recording contract.&lt;ref name="larryking" /&gt; McGraw's first single, "What Room Was the Holiday In", was released on March 29, 1991, and did not enter the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart upon its release.&lt;ref name="jessen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jessen|first=Wade|date=6 October 2001|title=A Record-Breaking Career|journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|pages=28, 34|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WxEEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=%22what+room+was+the+holiday+in%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=enXxU9z-JJelyATjg4HIBg&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22what%20room%20was%20the%20holiday%20in%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2001 retrospective on McGraw's career in ''Billboard'', a former program director for Nashville station [[WSM-FM]] said that he added the song to the station's playlist because it showed "undeniable promise",&lt;ref name="jessen"/&gt; while another former program director at [[WXTU]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] recalled that McGraw's debut single was "terrible" but that he booked the singer to make an appearance at the station due to his father's fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.today.com/id/17756431|title=At 39, Tim McGraw looking beyond music|work=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]|accessdate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three more singles were released from ''Tim McGraw'': "Welcome to the Club", "Memory Lane", and "Two Steppin' Mind". None made country Top 40 and the album itself did not chart.&lt;ref name="allmusic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/tim-mcgraw-mn0000592954/biography|title=Tim McGraw biography|last=Huey|first=Steve|work=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both "Memory Lane" and "Tears in the Rain", another cut from the album, were co-written by [[Joe Diffie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r169755|pure_url=yes}}|title=Tim McGraw - Tim McGraw|last=Mansfield|first=Brian|author2=Thom Jurek |work=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Memory Lane" had originally appeared on [[Keith Palmer (singer)|Keith Palmer]]'s self-titled 1991 debut album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes |title=Keith Palmer |others=Keith Palmer |year=1991 |type=CD insert |publisher=Epic Records |id=48611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Not a Moment Too Soon''====
McGraw's second album, entitled ''[[Not a Moment Too Soon]]'', was much more successful than his self-titled debut, and it was the best-selling country album of 1994. Its first single, "[[Indian Outlaw]]", resulted in some considerable controversy, as critics argued that it presented [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in a patronizing way.&lt;ref name="allmusic"/&gt; Some radio stations even chose not to play it.&lt;ref name="gerome"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gerome|first=John|title=Growing Strong – McGraw's reach encompasses country music, more|publisher=San Angelo Standard Times|date=April 13, 2007

|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the controversy helped spur sales, and the song became McGraw's first Top 10 hit on the U.S. country charts after getting as high as number 8&lt;ref name="Country Songs"/&gt;. The song also peaked at number 15 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].&lt;ref name="cmtcontroversy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Controversy: Episode "Indian Outlaw"|publisher=Country Music Television  |year=2003 |url=http://www.cmt.com/shows/dyn/controversy/67940/episode_about.jhtml|accessdate=April 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album's second single, "[[Don't Take the Girl]]", became McGraw's first number one on the U.S. country charts, in addition to peaking at number 17 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. The song also "helped cement his image as a ruggedly good-looking guy with a sensitive side."&lt;ref name="gerome" /&gt; By year's end, the third single from the album, "[[Down on the Farm (song)|Down on the Farm]]" peaked at number 2; after that, the album's fourth single, also its [[Not a Moment Too Soon (song)|title track]], became the singer's second number one hit in early-1995.

====''All I Want''====
McGraw's third studio album, ''[[All I Want (Tim McGraw album)|All I Want]]'', was released in 1995. Just like its predecessor, this album also debuted at No.&amp;nbsp;1 on the country charts. The album even sold over 2 million copies in the United States and reached the Top 5 on the ''Billboard'' 200. The album's first single, "[[I Like It, I Love It]]", became McGraw's third number one on the American country charts&lt;ref name="Country Songs"/&gt; and it also peaked at number 25 to the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. The album's next two singles, "[[Can't Be Really Gone]]" and "[[All I Want Is a Life]]" (its partial title-track) both made the top 5 at numbers 2 and 5, respectively. The fourth single, "[[She Never Lets It Go to Her Heart]]", gave McGraw his fourth number one on the U.S. country charts in 1996. Finishing off the singles was "[[Maybe We Should Just Sleep on It]]",&lt;ref name="Country Songs"/&gt; which peaked at number 4.

In 1996, McGraw headlined the most successful country tour of the year, The Spontaneous Combustion Tour, with [[Faith Hill]] as his supporting act. Hill broke off her engagement to her former producer [[Scott Hendricks]] so that she and McGraw could start dating each other; they then married on October 6, 1996. The couple have since had three daughters: Gracie Katherine (born May 1997), Maggie Elizabeth (born August 1998), and Audrey Caroline (born December 2001).&lt;ref name="internationalspeakers"&gt;{{cite web |title=Faith Hill |work= |publisher=InternationalSpeakers.Com |url=http://www.internationalspeakers.com/speakers/ISBB-55387D/Faith_Hill/ |accessdate=April 23, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070110174111/http://www.internationalspeakers.com/speakers/ISBB-55387D/Faith_Hill/ |archivedate=January 10, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gracie appears on "Here Tonight", the first track on McGraw's 2015 album ''[[Damn Country Music]]''.

====''Everywhere''====
The singer's fourth album, 1997's ''[[Everywhere (Tim McGraw album)|Everywhere]]'' was released in 1997. It topped the country charts as well, and reached No.&amp;nbsp;2 on the ''Billboard'' 200, selling 4 million copies.&lt;ref name="allmusic"/&gt;  The album spawned six singles. Four of those singles - "[[It's Your Love]]" (a duet with [[Faith Hill]], the [[Everywhere (Tim McGraw song)|title track]], "[[Where the Green Grass Grows]]", and "[[Just to See You Smile]]" - reached number one on the country charts. The [[Country Music Association]] awarded ''Everywhere'' its Album of the Year award for 1997. At the 40th Grammy Awards, "It's Your Love" received two [[Grammy Award]] nominations for Best Country Collaboration With Vocals and Best Country Song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalhit.com/grammy/40/nominees.shtml |title=40th Annual Grammy Award Nominations |work=DigitalHit.com |accessdate=March 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both "It's Your Love" and "Just to See You Smile" were the number one country songs of 1997 and 1998 according to ''Billboard'' Year-End charts;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end/1997/hot-country-songs |title=Year End Charts - Year-end Singles - Hot Country Songs |publisher=Billboard.com |accessdate=2009-08-31 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211063528/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_display.jsp?f=Hot+Country+Songs&amp;g=Year-end+Singles&amp;year=1997 |archivedate=2007-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end/1998/hot-country-songs |title=Year End Charts - Year-end Singles - Hot Country Songs |publisher=Billboard.com |accessdate=2009-08-31 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211063533/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_display.jsp?f=Hot+Country+Songs&amp;g=Year-end+Singles&amp;year=1998 |archivedate=2007-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Just to See You Smile" also set a record for the longest run on the country charts at the time, at 42 weeks.&lt;ref name="tmandthedd" /&gt; The album's other two singles, "[[One of These Days (Marcus Hummon song)|One of These Days]]" and "[[For a Little While]]" both peaked at number 2.

====''A Place in the Sun''====
McGraw's fifth album, ''[[A Place in the Sun (Tim McGraw album)|A Place in the Sun]]'', continued his streak in 1999, debuting atop both the US country and pop album charts&lt;ref name="cma" /&gt; and selling 3 million copies. Over 251,000 of those copies were sold during its first week, making this the singer's first number 1 opener on the ''Billboard'' 200. It produced another four number one hits on the U.S. country charts with "[[Please Remember Me]]", "[[Something Like That]]", "[[My Best Friend (song)|My Best Friend]]", and "[[My Next Thirty Years]]". "[[Some Things Never Change (song)|Some Things Never Change]]" peaked at number 7 on the charts.&lt;ref name="allmusic"/&gt; McGraw also contributed a song for the Grammy-winning tribute album to [[Bob Wills]] entitled ''Ride With Bob''. A cover of "Milk Cow Blues", this song was recorded as a duet with [[Asleep at the Wheel]], whom he had met while performing together at the George Strait Country Music Festival.&lt;ref name="cma" /&gt;

McGraw recorded two more duets with his wife in the late-1990s, both of which appeared on her albums. "[[Just to Hear You Say That You Love Me]]", from her multi-platinum-certified 1998 album ''[[Faith (Faith Hill album)|Faith]]'', reached the Top 5 of the US country charts.&lt;ref name="allmusic"/&gt; Her follow-up album, 1999's ''[[Breathe (Faith Hill album)|Breathe]]'', featured "[[Let's Make Love (song)|Let's Make Love]]", which won a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Best Country Vocal Collaboration]] in 2000.&lt;ref name="cma" /&gt;

===2000s===
[[File:Tim McGraw.jpg|thumb|McGraw performing for the United States Air Force in 2003]]
====''Greatest Hits''====
In 2000, McGraw released his first ''[[Greatest Hits (Tim McGraw album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album, which topped the country albums charts for nine weeks and sold nearly 6 million copies, making this one of the biggest-selling albums in the modern country market. In the latter half of the year, he and Hill went out on the [[Soul2Soul Tour]], playing to sellout crowds in 64 venues, including [[Madison Square Garden]]. The tour was one of the top tours of any genre in the U.S. It was also the leading country tour of 2000.&lt;ref name="tmandthedd" /&gt;

While in [[Buffalo, New York]], McGraw and [[Kenny Chesney]] became involved in a scuffle with police officers after Chesney attempted to ride a police horse. McGraw came to Chesney's aid after police officers nearby believed the horse was being stolen and tried to arrest him. The two were arrested and charged with assault, but were later cleared. During a concert with the George Strait Country Music Festival several weeks later, Hill, dressed as a police officer, made an unscheduled appearance at the end of McGraw's set and led him off the stage.&lt;ref name="ryan"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ryan |first=Harriet |title=The singers, the deputies, and a horse |publisher=CourtTV |date=March 14, 2001 |url=http://www.courttv.com/archive/trials/countrymusic/051401_ctv.html |accessdate=March 15, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630024549/http://www.courttv.com/archive/trials/countrymusic/051401_ctv.html |archivedate=June 30, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Set This Circus Down''====
McGraw's sixth studio album, ''[[Set This Circus Down]]'', was released in April 2001. It even spawned four number one hits on the country charts as well, this time with "[[Grown Men Don't Cry]]", "[[Angry All the Time]]" (with Faith Hill), "[[The Cowboy in Me]]", and "[[Unbroken (Tim McGraw song)|Unbroken]]". The singer provided harmony vocals for [[Jo Dee Messina]]'s song "[[Bring On the Rain]]", which he also produced. That song topped the country charts.&lt;ref name="cma" /&gt;

Hungry for more of his music, fans downloaded a version of his performance of the song "Things Change" from his appearance at the [[Country Music Association]] Awards Show.  The song was played extensively on radio, becoming the first country song to appear on the charts from a fully downloaded version.&lt;ref name="tmandthedd" /&gt;

====''Tim McGraw and the Dancehall Doctors''====
In 2002, McGraw bucked country music traditions by recording his seventh studio album ''[[Tim McGraw and the Dancehall Doctors]]'' with his tour band The Dancehall Doctors. Unlike rock music — where it is commonplace for touring bands to provide the music on albums recorded by the artist they support, country albums are typically recorded with [[session musician]]s.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;
{{cite news   | last =Tyrangiel  | first = Josh  | title = The Clinton of Country  | work =  | publisher = Time Magazine  |date=September 13, 2004  | url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,695870,00.html  | accessdate =March 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; McGraw chose to use his own touring band, in order to recognize their part in 
his success, and to capture some of the feel of a real band.&lt;ref name="tmandthedd" /&gt;

All of the Dancehall Doctors have worked with McGraw since at least 1996. Their lineup includes:
* Darran Smith – lead guitar, acoustic guitar
* Bob Minner – rhythm guitar, acoustic guitar, banjo, mandolin
* Denny Hemingson – steel guitar, electric, baritone, and slide guitars, dobro
* John Marcus – bass guitar
* Dean Brown – fiddle, mandolin
* Jeff McMahon – piano, organ, synthesizer, keyboards
* Billy Mason – drums
* David Dunkley – percussion&lt;ref name="tmandthedd"&gt;{{Cite journal  | title = Tim McGraw and the Dancehall Doctors – Bio  | place= Liner notes for album ''Tim McGraw and the Dancehall Doctors''  | publisher = Curb Records  | year = 2001  | url =http://countrymusic.about.com/library/bltim-bio.htm  &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album debuted at No.&amp;nbsp;2 on the country albums charts,&lt;ref name="larryking"&gt;{{Cite journal  | title = Interviews with Joe Biden, Chuck Hagel, Tim McGraw  | place= Larry King Live  | publisher = CNN  | date = December 10, 2002  | url =http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0212/10/lkl.00.html  &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its fourth and fifth singles "[[Real Good Man]]" and "[[Watch the Wind Blow By]]" both climbed to number one on the U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart. "[[She's My Kind of Rain]]" peaked at No.&amp;nbsp;2 in 2003, and "[[Red Rag Top]]" reached number 5. The album also features a cover of [[Elton John]]'s early-1970s classic "[[Tiny Dancer]]", as well as duets with [[Kim Carnes]] on "Comfort Me" (a response to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]) and [[Don Henley]] and [[Timothy B. Schmit]] of [[the Eagles]] on "Illegal". "[[She's My Kind of Rain]]"  also received a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for Best Country Vocal Performance-Male at the [[46th Grammy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,555458,00.html|title=Grammylicious|last=Susman|first=Gary|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=2009-04-23|date=December 4, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Live Like You Were Dying''====
His eighth album, 2004's ''[[Live Like You Were Dying]]'', continued the singer's record of commercial success. The album's first single and its [[Live Like You Were Dying (song)|title track]] was dedicated to his father [[Tug McGraw]], who died of a brain tumor earlier in the year, was an ode to living life fully and in the moment. &lt;ref name="mcnary"&gt;{{cite web  | last = McNary  | first =  Dave | title = 'Dying' for a deal  | work=  | publisher = Variety  | date = December 12, 2004  | url =http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117914872.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1&amp;query=tim+mcgraw  | accessdate =April 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second single "[[Back When]]" was a [[paean]] to an easy nostalgia. "Live Like You Were Dying" spent seven non-consecutive weeks at No.&amp;nbsp;1 on ''Billboard'' and went on to become the top country song of 2004 on the ''Billboard'' Year-End charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end/2004/hot-country-songs |title=Year End Charts - Year-end Singles - Hot Country Songs |publisher=Billboard.com |accessdate=2009-08-31 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211063553/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_display.jsp?f=Hot+Country+Songs&amp;g=Year-end+Singles&amp;year=2004 |archivedate=2007-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also became one of the most awarded records by winning ACM Single and Song of the Year, CMA Single and Song of the Year, and a Grammy. "Back When" went to number one on the country charts as well. The album produced three more singles with "[[Drugs or Jesus]]", "[[Do You Want Fries with That]]", and "[[My Old Friend]]". "Drugs or Jesus" became McGraw's first single since 1993 to not ever reach within the Top 10 on the U.S. country charts, while "Do You Want Fries with That" and "My Old Friend" peaked at numbers 5 and 6, respectively. 

In late 2004, his unlikely [[Duet (music)|duet]] with hip hop artist [[Nelly]] on "[[Over and Over (Nelly song)|Over and Over]] became a [[Crossover music|crossover]] hit,&lt;ref name="sixshot"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; spending 10 weeks atop the top 40 chart. "Over and Over" brought McGraw a success he had never previously experienced on [[contemporary hit radio]] or R&amp;B radio, and brought both artists success neither had previously experienced in the [[hot adult contemporary]] market. The song also spent a week at the top of the charts in the United Kingdom, becoming McGraw's first hit single in Britain and Nelly's third number one hit in the country after "[[Dilemma (song)|Dilemma]]" and "[[My Place (Nelly song)|My Place]]". "Over and Over" also reached the top of the charts in Australia, New Zealand and the Republic of Ireland, and the top 10 in Austria, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Romania and Switzerland.

Throughout the 2005 [[NFL]] season, McGraw sang an alternate version of "I Like It, I Love It" every week during the season. The alternate lyrics, which changed each week, would make reference to plays during Sunday's games, and the song would be played alongside video highlights during halftime on ''[[Monday Night Football]]''.&lt;ref name="kelley"&gt;{{cite web  | last = Kelley  | first = Austin | title = Pigskin Poet  | work=  | publisher = The New Yorker  |date=October 10, 2005  | url =http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/10/10/051010ta_talk_kelley  | accessdate =March 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in the year, McGraw became a minority owner of the [[Arena Football League (1987–2008)|Arena Football League]]'s [[Nashville Kats]] when majority owner [[Bud Adams]] (owner of the NFL's [[Tennessee Titans]]) was awarded the expansion franchise.&lt;ref name="arenafootball"&gt;{{cite web  | title = Tim McGraw owner of Arena Football Team  | work=  | publisher = USAToday  | date = November 2, 2004  | url =https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2004-11-02-mcgraw-football_x.htm  | accessdate =March 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Let It Go''====
[[File:Tim McGraw Dallas 2009.jpg|thumb|McGraw performing during the [[Soul2Soul Tour]], July 2006 photo by T. Scott/Sisters Photography]]
In April 2006, McGraw and Hill began their 73-concert 55-city [[Soul2Soul II Tour]], again to strong commercial acceptance.  The tour grossed roughly $89 million and sold approximately 1.1 million tickets, making it the top grossing tour in the history of country music.&lt;ref name="soul2"&gt;{{cite news |title=Tim, Faith set tour mark |work= |publisher=Country Standard Time |date=September 14, 2006 |url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/newsitem.asp?xid=221 |accessdate=March 15, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312222819/http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/newsitem.asp?xid=221 |archivedate=March 12, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also named "Major Tour of the Year" by the prestigious ''Pollstar Magazine'', beating out such heavyweights as Madonna and the Rolling Stones. In a special gesture, the couple donated all of the profits from their performance in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] to Hurricane Katrina relief.&lt;ref name="katrina"&gt;{{cite news  | title = Tim McGraw and Faith Hill concert to benefit Katrina relief  | work =   | publisher = Country Standard Time  | date = May 12, 2006  | url = http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/newsitem.asp?xid=39  | accessdate = March 15, 2007  | deadurl = yes  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070312222707/http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/newsitem.asp?xid=39  | archivedate = March 12, 2007  | df =   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

McGraw, along with [[Kenny Chesney]], contributed to a version of [[Tracy Lawrence]]'s song "[[Find Out Who Your Friends Are]]", which can be found on Lawrence's album ''[[For the Love]]''. Although the official single version features only Lawrence's vocals, many stations have opted to play the version with McGraw and Chesney instead.

McGraw released his eleventh studio album, ''[[Let It Go (Tim McGraw album)|Let It Go]]'', on March 27, 2007. The album's first single, "[[Last Dollar (Fly Away)]]", peaked at number one on the [[Hot Country Songs]] chart. This marked McGraw's first No.&amp;nbsp;1 single since "Back When" in late-2004. The album debuted at No.&amp;nbsp;1 on both the ''Billboard'' 200 and Top Country Album charts, marking his fourth No.&amp;nbsp;1 album on the 200 charts and his ninth overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=tim mcgraw|chart=all}}|title=Let It Go - Tim McGraw -- Billboard.com|accessdate=September 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His daughters can be heard singing the chorus during the last few seconds of the song on the video.

During the [[Academy of Country Music]] awards show on May 21, 2007, McGraw performed a song titled "[[If You're Reading This]]", which he co-wrote with [[The Warren Brothers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_headlines/article/0,,GAC_26063_5547858,00.html |title=Tim McGraw's Special Tribute |publisher=Gactv.com |accessdate=2011-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20070616050442/http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_headlines/article/0,,GAC_26063_5547858,00.html |archivedate=2007-06-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several radio stations began to play the live recording of the song; as a result, it entered the U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart at No.&amp;nbsp;35.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.engine145.com/tim-mcgraws-if-youre-reading-this-is-in-high-demand/ |title=Tim McGraw's "If You’re Reading This" Is In High Demand – Engine 145 |publisher=Engine145.com |date=2007-05-25 |accessdate=2011-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218112220/http://www.engine145.com/tim-mcgraws-if-youre-reading-this-is-in-high-demand/ |archivedate=2014-12-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

McGraw also produced [[Halfway to Hazard (album)|the debut album]] of country music duo [[Halfway to Hazard]]. The duo's first single, "Daisy", peaked at No.&amp;nbsp;39 on the country charts in the summer of 2007.

In the summer of 2007, McGraw and Hill toured together once again in the [[Soul2Soul 2007]] tour.

In the January 18, 2008 edition of the ''USA Today'' newspaper, McGraw was stated to be featured on the [[Def Leppard]] album ''[[Songs from the Sparkle Lounge]]'', having also co-written the first single, "[[Nine Lives (Def Leppard song)|Nine Lives]]", with Def Leppard band members [[Joe Elliott]], [[Phil Collen]], and [[Rick Savage]]. The unusual pairing goes back to 2006 when McGraw joined Def Leppard onstage for the song "[[Pour Some Sugar On Me]]", and then collaborated on the song "Nine Lives" afterward. The album was released on April 25, 2008.

At the 2007 50th Annual Grammy Awards, McGraw received 5 nominations including Best Country Album (for ''Let It Go'', Best Country Song (both for "[[If You're Reading This]]" and "[[I Need You (Tim McGraw and Faith Hill song)|I Need You]]"), Best Country Collaboration with Vocals (with "I Need You"), and Best Male Country Vocal Performance (with "If You're Reading This").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/56915/nominations-for-50th-annual-grammy-awards/ |title=Nomination's For 50th Annual Grammy Awards. |publisher=eonline.com |date=2007-12-06 |accessdate=2012-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, he hit the road with the Live Your Voice tour. The mainly-outdoor arena concert tour was his first solo outing in nearly three years. Also in May 2008, he debuted a new song off of his follow-up to ''Let It Go'' at the Stagecoach Music Festival in Indio, California.

In July 2008, the album's sixth single and its title track, "[[Let It Go (Tim McGraw song)|Let It Go]]", was released to country radio. Following that, a seventh single, "[[Nothin' to Die For]]", entered the Country charts at No.&amp;nbsp;57 in late December. McGraw released his third greatest-hits package, ''[[Greatest Hits 3 (Tim McGraw album)|Greatest Hits 3]]'' on October 7, 2008. The album features 12 tracks. McGraw was set to debut a new song on the 2009 ACM Awards, but then cancelled his performance; he was replaced by [[Blake Shelton]], who sang "[[She Wouldn't Be Gone]]".

====''Southern Voice''====
[[File:Tim McGraw &amp; Faith Hill AMA 2009.jpg|thumb|Tim McGraw with [[Faith Hill]] at the 2009 [[American Music Awards]]]]
McGraw's twelfth studio album, ''[[Southern Voice (album)|Southern Voice]]'', was released October 20, 2009, and led by the single "[[It's A Business Doing Pleasure With You]]", which was shipped to radio outlets in late June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countryondemand.com/news/2009/06/first-new-music-in-over-two-years-on.shtml |title=First new music in over two years on horizon for McGraw |publisher=Country On Demand |accessdate=June 28, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703180845/http://www.countryondemand.com/news/2009/06/first-new-music-in-over-two-years-on.shtml |archivedate=July 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Southern Voice'' was argued to be McGraw's last album for Curb Records, following the dispute over releasing his third Greatest Hits collection back in October 2008 without his permission.&lt;ref&gt;Waddell, Ray. "Touring Over a New Leaf: With New Managers and Ambitious Concert Plans, Tim McGraw Isn't Resting on His Laurels". Billboard - The International Newsweekly of Music, Video and Home Entertainment Sep 19 2009: 20-3. ProQuest. Web. 19 July 2015 .&lt;/ref&gt; McGraw did not approve of the release. On November 30, 2010, Curb Records released his fourth greatest hits compilation, ''[[Number One Hits (Tim McGraw album)|Number One Hits]]''.

On October 4, 2016, during a show at the Ryman Auditorium, McGraw and Hill announced that they would be going back on the road together again on the [[Soul2Soul: The World Tour|Soul2Soul World Tour]]. The tour began on April 7, 2017, in [[New Orleans]] and will continue into 2018, incorporating the [[C2C: Country to Country]] festival held in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] throughout March 2018.&lt;ref name="2017 Soul2Soul World Tour"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dukes|first1=Billy|title=Tim McGraw and Faith Hill Announce 2017 Soul2Soul World Tour|url=http://tasteofcountry.com/tim-mcgraw-faith-hill-2017-soul2soul-tour/|website=Taste of Country|publisher=Taste of Country Network|date=October 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McGraw has occasionally served as a [[record producer]] in collaboration with [[Byron Gallimore]], who has co-produced all of his albums. The two co-produced [[Jo Dee Messina]]'s [[Jo Dee Messina (album)|self-titled debut]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/jo-dee-messina-mw0000185556|title=''Jo Dee Messina''|last=Dillon|first=Charlotte|work=Allmusic|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as her next two albums, ''[[I'm Alright (Jo Dee Messina album)|I'm Alright]]'' and ''[[Burn (Jo Dee Messina album)|Burn]]''.

==Acting career==
McGraw's first acting appearance came in a 1997 episode of ''[[The Jeff Foxworthy Show]]'', where he played Foxworthy's rival.

In 2004, McGraw played a sheriff in [[Rick Schroder]]'s independent release ''[[Black Cloud]]''. Later in the same year, McGraw received critical acclaim as the overbearing father of a [[running back]] in the major studio Texas high school football drama ''[[Friday Night Lights (film)|Friday Night Lights]]''. The ''[[Dallas Observer]]'' said the role was "played with unexpected ferocity by country singer Tim McGraw".&lt;ref name="wilonsky"&gt;{{cite web  | last = Wilonsky  | first =  Robert | title = Hell of a Catch  | work=  | publisher = The Dallas Observer  |date=October 7, 2004  | url =http://www.dallasobserver.com/2004-10-07/film/hell-of-a-catch/  | accessdate =March 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The movie went on to gross over $60 million worldwide at the box office,&lt;ref name="weinstein"&gt;{{cite web  | last = Weinstein  | first =  Joshua L. | title = Hollywood via Nashville  | work= Variety  | date = May 22, 2006  | url =http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117943931.html?categoryid=1236&amp;cs=1&amp;query=tim+mcgraw  | accessdate =April 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sold millions in the DVD market. Most recently, it was named one of the Top 50 High School Movies of All Time (No.&amp;nbsp;37) by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.

McGraw's first lead role was in the 2006 film ''[[Flicka]]'', which was released in theaters October 20, 2006.  In the remake of the classic book ''[[My Friend Flicka]]'', McGraw played the father, Rob, costarring with [[Alison Lohman]] and [[Maria Bello]].  The family-friendly movie debuted in the top 10 list and has grossed over $25 million at the box office.&lt;ref name="flickaboxoffice"&gt;{{cite web  | title = Flicka  | work=  | publisher =Box Office Mojo  | url =http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=homevideo&amp;id=flicka.htm  | accessdate =March 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  McGraw again achieved critical acclaim for his acting.&lt;ref name="mccarthy"&gt;{{cite web  | last = McCarthy  | first =  Todd | title = Flicka  | work=  | publisher = Variety  |date=October 17, 2006  | url =http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117931913.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1  | accessdate =March 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hartlaub"&gt;{{cite web  | last = Hartlaub  | first =  Peter | title = McGraw alone can't rein in unruly 'Flicka{{'-}}| work= The San Francisco Chronicle  |date=October 20, 2006  | url =http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/10/20/DDGFFLRSLP1.DTL&amp;type=movies  | accessdate =March 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before ''Flicka'' opened, McGraw received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. His star is located at 6901 Hollywood Boulevard near stars honoring [[Julie Andrews]], [[William Shatner]], and the late [[Greta Garbo]]. One of his ''Flicka'' co-stars, [[Alison Lohman]], attended the ceremony that included comments from [[Billy Bob Thornton]], McGraw's co-star in the film ''[[Friday Night Lights (film)|Friday Night Lights]]''.&lt;ref name="walkoffame"&gt;{{cite news |title=Tim McGraw Receiving Star on Hollywood Walk of Fame |work= |publisher=CMT |date=September 14, 2006 |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/articles/1543037/10122006/mcgraw_tim.jhtml |accessdate=March 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to acting in ''Flicka'', McGraw served as executive producer of the soundtrack album, which was released by his record label, StyleSonic Records, in association with Curb Records and Fox 2000 films. It featured the closing credit song "[[My Little Girl (song)|My Little Girl]]",  one of the first two songs that McGraw recorded that he also co-wrote (the other being "I've Got Friends That Do", both of which were included on ''Greatest Hits Vol. 2'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livedaily.com/news/Briefly_Tim_McGraw_Master_P_Silkk_the_Shocker_Pete_Doherty-9677.html |title=Briefly: Tim McGraw, Master P, Silkk the Shocker, Pete Doherty |publisher=LiveDaily |accessdate=2011-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608193542/http://www.livedaily.com/news/Briefly_Tim_McGraw_Master_P_Silkk_the_Shocker_Pete_Doherty-9677.html |archivedate=2008-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was nominated by the Broadcast Film Critics for "Best Song" in a film, and the movie was nominated in the category "Best Family Film (Live Action)". The movie proved to be another success in the DVD market, and has sold over a million copies, debuting at No.&amp;nbsp;3 on the DVD sales chart.&lt;ref name="flickaboxoffice" /&gt;

McGraw also had a small part in the Michael Mann–produced 2007 film ''[[The Kingdom (film)|The Kingdom]]'', reuniting him with ''Friday Night Lights'' director [[Peter Berg]]. McGraw played a bitter, angered widower whose wife was killed in the terrorist attack that is the centerpiece of the movie.

On November 22, 2008, McGraw made his first appearance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. He also played "Dallas McVie" in ''[[Four Christmases]]''.

McGraw appeared in the 2009 film ''[[The Blind Side (film)|The Blind Side]]'' as [[Sean Tuohy]], husband of [[Sandra Bullock]]'s character, [[Leigh Anne Tuohy]]. ''The Blind Side'' is based on the true story of [[Michael Oher]], a homeless African-American youngster from a broken home, taken in and adopted by the Tuohys, a well-to-do white family who help him fulfill his potential. For her performance Bullock won the Oscar for Best Actress in a Leading Role.

He is among the stars of ''[[Dirty Girl (2010 film)|Dirty Girl]]'', a film that premiered on September 12, 2010, at the Toronto Film Festival, along with [[Juno Temple]], [[Milla Jovovich]], [[William H. Macy]] and [[Dwight Yoakam]].

Also in 2010, McGraw starred in ''[[Country Strong]]'' as James Canter, the husband and manager of the fictional country singer Kelly Canter (portrayed by [[Gwyneth Paltrow]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://us99country.radio.com/2010/12/15/photo-gallery-country-strong-premiere/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120719142013/http://us99country.radio.com/2010/12/15/photo-gallery-country-strong-premiere/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-19 |title=Country Strong Hits Hollywood |publisher=Us99country.radio.com |accessdate=2011-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his appearance in the film, McGraw's song "Me and Tennessee", a duet with Paltrow, was played during the closing credits.

In 2015, McGraw appeared in ''[[Tomorrowland (film)|Tomorrowland]]'' as Eddie Newton, Casey's father (Casey Newton - a main character played by Britt Robertson) and NASA engineer

==Charitable efforts==
In 1994, when McGraw first reached fame, he established the annual Swampstock event.  It began as a charity softball game to raise money for hometown little league programs; the event now includes a celebrity softball game and a multi-artist concert that attracts over 11,000 fans per year.  The combined events have funded new [[Little League]] parks and equipment, and have established college scholarship funds for students in the northeast Louisiana area.&lt;ref name="awareness"&gt;{{cite web|title=Awareness |work= |publisher=TimMcGraw.Com |year=2007 |url=http://www.timmcgraw.com/awareness |accessdate=March 15, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070709013240/http://www.timmcgraw.com/awareness |archivedate=July 9, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1996 to 1999, McGraw hosted an annual New Year's Eve concert in Nashville with special guests including [[Jeff Foxworthy]], the [[Dixie Chicks]], and [[Martina McBride]].  The 1997 show raised over $100,000 for the Country Music Foundation Hall of Fame and Museum.  Beginning in 1999, McGraw would pick select cities on each tour, and the night before he was scheduled to perform, would choose a local club and host a quickly-organized show. This tour-within-a-tour became known as "The Bread and Water Tour", and all proceeds from the show would go to a charity from that community.&lt;ref name="awareness" /&gt;

McGraw designed a charity T-shirt sold through Angelwear to benefit MusiCares. MusiCares supports musicians in times of need. His charity focus particularly on health issues. The Tim McGraw Foundation raises funds to enhance the quality of life of children and adults with brain tumors. He supports the Muhammad Ali Parkinson Center, the David Foster Foundation, which helps families of children in need of organ transplants, and Musicians on Call, which brings music to hospital patients' bedsides. He also performs during dinners and auctions to benefit children with disabilities. Hill and McGraw gave the Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society $375,000 (the entire gate receipts from one of their concerts) to assist the families of 17 sailors following the terrorist attack on {{USS|Cole|DDG-67|6}}, the guided missile destroyer that suffered significant damage in the Gulf of Aden, Yemen on October 12, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McGraw|first1=Tim|title=Tim McGraw Charity Work, Events, and Causes|url=https://www.looktothestars.org/celebrity/tim-mcgraw|website=Look to The Stars|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the days immediately following [[Hurricane Katrina]], McGraw and his wife, who was raised in [[Mississippi]], joined groups taking supplies to [[Gulfport, Mississippi]].  The two also hosted several charity concerts to benefit those who were displaced by the storm.&lt;ref name="abcnews"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gordon|first=Dan|author2=[[Buck Wolf]]|title=Faith Hill, Tim McGraw Blast 'Humiliating' Katrina Cleanup|publisher=ABC News|date=March 8, 2006|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=1702714&amp;page=2|accessdate=March 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in the year, the couple established the Neighbor's Keeper Foundation, which provides funding for community charities to assist with basic humanitarian services, in the event of a natural disaster, or for desperate personal circumstances.

McGraw is also a member of the [[American Red Cross]] National Celebrity Cabinet, to which various celebrities donate their time, skills, and fame, to help the Red Cross highlight important initiatives and response efforts.&lt;ref name="redcross"&gt;{{cite web|title=American Red Cross National Celebrity Cabinet Members|publisher=The American Red Cross|year=2007|url=http://www.redcross.org/news/other/entertainment/natcelebcab/2007_members.asp|accessdate=March 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McGraw has helped out with charity events held by [[Minnesota Vikings]] quarterback [[Brett Favre]]. The [[Brett Favre]] Fourward&lt;!--This is the correct spelling of his foundation. See his official website.--&gt; Foundation has featured McGraw (and at other times Faith Hill) performing concerts during dinners and auctions that benefit children with disabilities in Wisconsin and Mississippi. One instance is recorded on Favre's official website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.officialbrettfavre.com/news/story_e23f2d11758c8034/ |title=Favre's golf tourney a success for QB, charity |work=Official Website of Brett Favre |date=April 5, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 12, 2007, it was made public that McGraw and his wife Faith Hill, while in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]] for a performance, donated $5,000 to Kailey Kozminski, 3-year-old daughter of Officer Robert Kozminski, a Grand Rapids police officer who was killed on July 8, 2007, while responding to a domestic disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jessica Puchala|last=John Bumgardner|url=http://www.koz089.com/index.php?page=article&amp;no=5|title=Country Music Couple Donates $5,000 to Kozminski Fund|work=Grand Rapids Police Officer Robert Kozminski|date=July 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010, McGraw and his wife Faith Hill organized Nashville Rising, a benefit concert aimed to raise $2 million for The Community Foundation of Middle Tennessee in response to the flood in early May that killed 22 people and caused $2 billion in damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/957660/country-rock-stars-join-for-nashville-rising-benefit |title=Country, Rock Stars Join For 'Nashville Rising' Benefit |work=Billboard|date=2009-09-14 |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

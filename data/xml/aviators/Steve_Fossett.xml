'''James Stephen "Steve" Fossett''' (April 22, 1944 – September 3, 2007) was an American businessman and a record-setting aviator, sailor, and adventurer. He was the first person to fly solo nonstop around the world in a balloon. He made his fortune in the financial services industry and was best known for many [[world record]]s, including five nonstop [[List of circumnavigations|circumnavigation]]s of the Earth: as a long-distance solo [[hot air balloon|balloonist]], as a sailor, and as a solo flight [[fixed-wing aircraft]] pilot.

A fellow of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] and the [[Explorers Club]], Fossett set more than one hundred records{{vs|date=May 2015}} in five different sports, sixty of which still stood at the time of his death.&lt;ref name="telegraphJune2007"&gt;{{cite news

Fossett disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying a light aircraft over the [[Great Basin Desert]], between Nevada and California. Extensive searches proved unsuccessful, and he was [[declared death in absentia|declared legally dead]] in February of the following year.

In September 2008, a hiker found Fossett's identification cards  in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada Mountains]], California, leading shortly after to the discovery of the plane's wreckage. Fossett's only known remains, two large bones, were found half a mile from the crash site, probably scattered by wild animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/10/02/steve.fossett.search/index.html|title=Some remains found in Fossett plane wreckage - CNN.com|website=www.cnn.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/3125782/Body-parts-found-in-wreckage-of-Steve-Fossetts-plane.html|title='Body parts' found in wreckage of Steve Fossett's plane|last=York|first=By Tom Leonard in New|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2017-05-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Fossett was born in [[Jackson, Tennessee]] and grew up in [[Garden Grove, California]], where he graduated from [[Garden Grove High School]].&lt;ref name="telegraphJune2007"/&gt;

Fossett's interest in adventure began early. As a [[Boy Scout]], he grew up climbing the mountains of California, beginning with the [[San Jacinto Mountains]].&lt;ref name="airportjournal"&gt;{{cite web

In 1968, Fossett received an MBA from the [[Olin Business School|Olin School of Business]] at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], Missouri, where he was later a longtime member of the Board of Trustees.&lt;ref name="stlpostdispatch"&gt;{{cite news

Fossett later said, "For the first five years of my business career, I was distracted by being in computer systems, and then I became interested in financial markets. That's where I thrived."&lt;ref name="airportjournal"/&gt;

Fossett then became a successful [[commodity broker|commodities salesman]] in Chicago, first for [[Merrill Lynch]] in 1973, where he proved a highly successful producer of commission revenue for himself and that firm. He began working in 1976 for [[Drexel Burnham]], which assigned him one of its memberships on the [[Chicago Board of Trade]] and permitted him to market the services of the firm from a phone on the floor of that exchange. In 1980, Fossett began the process that eventually produced his enduring prosperity: renting exchange memberships to would-be floor traders, first on the [[Chicago Board Options Exchange]].&lt;ref name="stanfordalumni"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USAToday2006"&gt;{{cite news| last =Halvorson

He earned millions renting [[floor trading]] privileges (exchange memberships) to hopeful new floor traders, who would also pay clearing fees to Fossett's clearing firms in proportion to the trading activity of those renting the memberships. In 1997, the trading volume of its rented memberships was larger than any other clearing firm on the Chicago exchange.&lt;ref name="stanfordalumni"/&gt; Lakota Trading replicated that same business plan on many exchanges in the United States and also in London.&lt;ref name="airportjournal"/&gt; Fossett would later use those revenues to finance his adventures.&lt;ref name="telegraphJune2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cnnstory2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="foxnews"/&gt; Fossett said, "As a floor trader, I was very aggressive and worked hard.

Fossett said he did not participate in any of the "interesting things" he had done in college during his time in exchange-related activities: "There was a period of time where I wasn't doing anything except working for a living. I became very frustrated with that and finally made up my mind to start getting back into things."&lt;ref name="airportjournal"/&gt; He began to take six weeks a year off to spend time on sports and moved to [[Beaver Creek, Colorado]] in 1990.

==Records==

===Overview===
Steve Fossett was well known for his world records and adventures in balloons, sailboats, gliders, and powered aircraft. He was an aviator of exceptional breadth of experience. He wanted to become the first person to achieve a solo [[balloon (aircraft)|balloon]] flight around the world (finally succeeding on his sixth attempt, in 2002, becoming the first person to complete an uninterrupted and unrefueled solo [[circumnavigation]] of the world in ''any'' kind of aircraft). He set, with co-pilot Terry Delore, 10 of the 21 Glider Open records, including the first 2,000&amp;nbsp;km Out-and-Return, the first 1,500&amp;nbsp;km Triangle and the longest Straight Distance flights. His achievements as a jet pilot in a [[Cessna Citation X]] include records for U.S. Transcontinental, Australia Transcontinental, and Round-the-World westbound non-supersonic flights.&lt;ref name="eagletter"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Fossett Sets Another World Record | journal=Eagletter|year=Fall 2006 |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to Fossett's aviation records, no pilot had held world records in more than one class of aircraft; Fossett held them in four classes.&lt;ref name="airportjournal"/&gt;

In 2005 Fossett made the first solo, nonstop unrefueled circumnavigation of the world in an airplane, in 67 hours in the [[Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer]], a single-engine jet aircraft.

In 2006, he again circumnavigated the globe nonstop and unrefueled in 76 hours, 45 minutes in the ''GlobalFlyer'', setting the record for the longest flight by any aircraft in history with a distance of 25,766 statute miles (41,467&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref name="telegraphJune2007"/&gt;

He set 91 aviation world records ratified by [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]], of which 36 stand,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Balloon pilot===

On February 21, 1995, Fossett landed in [[Leader, Saskatchewan]], Canada, after taking off from [[South Korea]], becoming the first person to make a solo flight across the Pacific Ocean in a [[balloon (aircraft)|balloon]].&lt;ref name="apachievements"&gt;{{cite news

In 2002, he became the first person to fly around the world alone, nonstop in any kind of aircraft. He launched the 10-story high balloon ''Spirit of Freedom'' from [[Northam, Western Australia]] on June 19, 2002 and returned to Australia on July 3, 2002, subsequently landing in [[Queensland]]. Duration and distance of this solo balloon flight was 13 days, 8 hours, 33 minutes (14 days 19 hours 50 minutes to landing), 20,626.48 statute miles (33,195.10&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref name="apachievements"/&gt; The balloon dragged him along the ground for 20 minutes at the end of the flight. Only the capsule survived the landing; it was taken to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], where it was displayed.&lt;ref name="smithsonian_freedom_capsule"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collections.nasm.si.edu/code/emuseum.asp?quicksearch=A20030128000&amp;newstyle=single|title=Capsule, Balloon, / Bud Light Spirit of Freedom Capsule|publisher=Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum|location=Washington, DC|accessdate=October 2, 2008|work=Collections Database}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The control center for the mission was in [[Brookings Hall]] at [[Washington University in St. Louis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Fossett's top speed during the flight was {{convert|186|mi/h|km/h}} over the Indian Ocean. The trip set a number of records for ballooning: Fastest ({{convert|200|mph|km/h|sigfig=2}}, breaking his own previous record of {{convert|166|mph|km/h|sigfig=2}}), Fastest Around the World (13.5 days), Longest Distance Flown Solo in a Balloon ({{convert|20482.26|mi|km}}), and 24-Hour Balloon Distance ({{convert|3186.80|mi|km}} on July 1).&lt;ref name="noaa"&gt;{{cite web

While Fossett had financed five previous tries himself, his successful record-setting flight was sponsored by [[Bud Light]].&lt;ref name="smithsonian_freedom_capsule"/&gt; In the end, Fossett actually made money on all his balloon flights. He bought a contingency insurance policy for $500,000 that would pay him $3 million if he succeeded in the flight. Along with sponsorship, that payout meant that in the end Fossett did not have to spend any of his money other than for initial expenses.&lt;ref name="airportjournal"/&gt;

===Sailor===
Fossett was one of [[Sailing ship tactics|sailing's]] most prolific distance record holders. Speed sailing was his specialty and from 1993 to 2004 he dominated the record sheets, setting 23 official world records and nine distance race records. He is recognized by the World Sailing Speed Record Council as "the world's most accomplished speed sailor."&lt;ref name="telegraphJune2007"/&gt;

On the maxi-catamaran [[Cheyenne (catamaran)|Cheyenne]] (formerly named ''PlayStation''), Fossett twice set the prestigious [[24 hours distance record|24 Hour Record of Sailing]]. In October 2001, Fossett and his crew set a [[transatlantic sailing record|transatlantic record]] of 4 days 17 hours, shattering the previous record by 43 hours 35 minutes; an increase in average speed of nearly seven knots.

In early 2004, Fossett, as skipper, set the [[Around the world sailing record]] of 58 days, 9 hours in ''Cheyenne'' with a crew of 13. In 2007, Fossett held the world record for crossing the Pacific Ocean in his {{convert|125|ft|m|adj=on}} sailboat, the ''PlayStation'', which he accomplished on his fourth try.&lt;ref name="stanfordalumni"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yachtsman"/&gt;

At the time of his death a submarine, [[DeepFlight Challenger]], was under construction to enable Fossett to be the first solo submariner to reach the [[Challenger Deep]].&lt;ref name=KGO-2008-10-02&gt;KGO-TV ABC 7, [http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/local/east_bay&amp;id=6429493 "Fossett's secret project was built in Richmond"], Thursday October 2, 2008 (accessed March 27, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Airship pilot===
Fossett set the Absolute World Speed Record for airships on October 27, 2004. The new record for fastest flight was accomplished with a [[Zeppelin NT]], at a recorded average speed of {{convert|62.2|kn|km/h mph}}. The previous record was {{convert|50.1|kn|km/h mph}} set in 2001 in a Virgin airship. In 2006, Fossett was one of only 17 pilots in the world licensed to fly the Zeppelin.&lt;ref name="airportjournal"/&gt;

===Fixed-wing aircraft pilot===
[[File:Steve Fossett in GlobalFlyer cockpit 1.jpg|thumb|right|287px|Fossett at NASA [[Kennedy Space Center]]'s Shuttle Landing Facility seated in the [[Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer]] cockpit]]

====GlobalFlyer====

Fossett made the first solo nonstop unrefueled fixed-wing aircraft flight around the world between February 28 and March 3, 2005. He took off from [[Salina, Kansas]], where he was assisted by faculty members and students from [[Kansas State University]], and flew eastbound with the prevailing winds, returning to Salina after 67 hours, 1 minute, 10 seconds, without refueling or making intermediate landings. His average speed of {{convert|342.2|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} was also the absolute world record for "speed around the world, nonstop and non-refueled." His aircraft, the [[Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer]], had a [[carbon fiber reinforced plastic]] airframe with a single [[Williams FJ44]] turbofan engine. It was designed and built by [[Burt Rutan]] and his company, [[Scaled Composites]], for long-distance solo flight. The [[fuel fraction]], the weight of the fuel divided by the weight of the aircraft at take-off, was 83 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11279696/ Fossett sets record for longest nonstop flight] February 11, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4316599.stm "''Fossett sets solo flight record''"] – [[BBC News]] article dated March 3, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2005/TECH/03/03/globalflyer.fossett/ "''Fossett makes history''"] – [[CNN.com]] article dated March 4, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 11, 2006, Fossett set the absolute world record for "distance without landing" by flying from the [[Kennedy Space Center]], Florida, around the world eastbound, then upon returning to Florida continuing across the [[Atlantic]] a second time to land in [[Bournemouth]], England. The official distance was 25,766 statute miles (41,467&amp;nbsp;km) and the duration was 76 hours 45 minutes.

The next month, Fossett made a third flight around the world in order to break the absolute record for "Distance over a closed circuit without landing" (with takeoff and landing at the same airport). He took off from Salina, Kansas on March 14, 2006 and returned on March 17, 2006 after flying 25,262 statute miles (40,655&amp;nbsp;km).

There are only seven absolute world records for fixed-wing aircraft recognized by the [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] and Fossett broke three of them in the Virgin Atlantic ''GlobalFlyer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://records.fai.org/general_aviation/absolute.asp |title=Current Absolute General Aviation World Records |publisher=Records.fai.org |accessdate=July 18, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628225432/http://records.fai.org/general_aviation/absolute.asp &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three records were previously held by [[Dick Rutan]] and [[Jeana Yeager]] from their flight in the [[Rutan Voyager|Voyager]] in 1986.

====Transcontinental aircraft records====
Fossett set two U.S. transcontinental fixed-wing aircraft records in the same day. On February 5, 2003, Fossett and co-pilot Doug Travis flew his [[Cessna Citation X]] jet from [[San Diego]], California to [[Charleston, South Carolina]] in 2 hours, 56 minutes, 20 seconds, at an average speed of {{convert|726.83|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} to smash the transcontinental record for non-supersonic jets.

He returned to San Diego, then flew the same course as co-pilot for fellow adventurer [[Joe Ritchie]] in Ritchie's turboprop [[Piaggio Avanti]]. Their time was 3 hours, 51 minutes, 52 seconds, an average speed of {{convert|546.44|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, which broke the previous turboprop transcontinental record held by [[Chuck Yeager]] and Renald Davenport.

Fossett also set the east-to-west transcontinental record for non-supersonic fixed-wing aircraft on September 17, 2000. He flew from [[Jacksonville, Florida]] to San Diego, California in 3 hours, 29 minutes, at an average speed of {{convert|591.96|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.

====First trans-Atlantic flight re-enactment====
On July 2, 2005, Fossett and co-pilot Mark Rebholz recreated the first nonstop crossing of the Atlantic which was made by the British team of [[Alcock and Brown|John Alcock and Arthur Whitten Brown]] in June 1919 in a [[Vickers Vimy]] biplane. Their flight from [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's, Newfoundland]], Canada to [[Clifden]], [[County Galway]], Ireland in the open cockpit Vickers Vimy replica took 18 hours 25 minutes with 13 hours flown in instrument flight conditions. Because there was no airport in Clifden, Fossett and Rebholz landed on the 8th fairway of the [[Connemara]] Golf Links.&lt;ref name="airportjournal"/&gt;

====Glider records====
The team of Steve Fossett and Terry Delore (NZ) set ten official world records in gliders while flying in three major locations: New Zealand, Argentina, and Nevada, United States. An asterisk (*) indicates records subsequently broken by other pilots.

Fossett and co-pilot [[Einar Enevoldson]] flew a glider into the [[stratosphere]] on August 29, 2006. The flight set the [[Flight altitude record|Absolute Altitude Record]] for gliders at {{convert|15460|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Fossett and Enevoldson had made previous attempts in three countries over a period of five years before finally succeeding with this record flight. This endeavor is known as the [[Perlan Project]].

===Cross-country skiing===
As a young adventurer, Fossett was one of the first participants in the [[Worldloppet]], a series of cross country ski marathons around the world. While he had little experience as a skier, he was in the first group of 'citizen athletes' to participate in the series debut in 1979. And in 1980, he became the eighth skier to complete all 10 of the long distance races, earning a Worldloppet medallion. He has also set [[cross-country skiing]] records in Colorado, setting an [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]] to [[Vail, Colorado|Vail]] record of 59&amp;nbsp;h, 53&amp;nbsp;min, 30&amp;nbsp;s in February 1998, and an Aspen to [[Eagle, Colorado|Eagle]] record of 12 hr, 29 min in February 2001.&lt;ref name="airportjournal"/&gt;

===Mountain climbing===
Fossett was a lifelong mountain climber and had climbed the highest peaks on six of the seven continents.&lt;ref name="stanfordalumni"/&gt;&lt;ref name="foxnews"/&gt; In the 1980s, he became friends with [[Patrick Morrow]], who was attempting to climb the highest peaks on all seven continents for the "[[Seven Summits]]" world record, which Morrow achieved in 1985.  Fossett accompanied Morrow for his last three peaks, including [[Vinson Massif]] in Antarctica, [[Carstensz Pyramid]] in Oceania, and [[Elbrus]] in Europe.&lt;ref name="airportjournal"/&gt; While Fossett went on to climb almost all of the Seven Summits peaks himself, he declined to climb [[Mount Everest]] in 1992 due to [[asthma]].&lt;ref name="airportjournal"/&gt; He later returned to Antarctica to climb again.

===Other accomplishments===
Fossett competed in and completed premier endurance sports events, including the {{convert|1165|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race]], in which he finished 47th on his second try in 1992 after training for five years. He became the 270th person to swim across the [[English Channel]] on his fourth try in September 1985 with a time of 22 hours, 15 minutes.&lt;ref name="airportjournal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stanfordalumni"/&gt;&lt;ref name="apachievements"/&gt; Although Fossett said he was not a good enough swimmer "to make the varsity swim team", he found that he could swim for long periods.&lt;ref name="airportjournal"/&gt; Fossett competed in the [[Ironman Triathlon]] in Hawaii&lt;ref name="stlpostdispatch"/&gt; (finishing in 1996 in 15:53:10),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Fossett raced cars in the mid-1970s and later returned to the sport in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="airportjournal"/&gt; He competed in the [[24 hours of Le Mans]] road race in 1993 and in 1996,&lt;ref name="USAToday2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="foxnews"/&gt; along with the [[Dakar Rally|Paris to Dakar Rally]].&lt;ref name="stanfordalumni"/&gt;

===Previous attempts at records===
Fossett tried six times over seven years for the first solo balloon circumnavigation. His fifth attempt cost him $1.25 million of his own money; his sixth and successful attempt was commercially sponsored.&lt;ref name="airportjournal"/&gt; Two of the attempts were launched from [[Busch Memorial Stadium]] in [[St. Louis]], Missouri. [[Washington University in St. Louis]] served as control center for four of the six flights, including the record-breaking one.&lt;ref name="stlpostdispatch"/&gt;

In 1998, one of the unsuccessful attempts at the ballooning record ended with a five-mile (8&amp;nbsp;km) plummet into the [[Coral Sea]] off the coast of Australia that nearly killed Fossett;&lt;ref name="npr2007"/&gt; he waited 72 hours to be rescued, at a cost of $500,000.&lt;ref name="stlpostdispatch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="knightridder2002"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first attempt began in the Black Hills of [[South Dakota]] and ended outside [[Hampton, New Brunswick]] {{convert|1800|mi|km}} later. The second attempt, launched from Busch Stadium, cost $300,000 and lasted {{convert|9600|mi|km}} before being downed halfway in a tree in [[India]]; the trip set records at the time for duration and distance of flight (with Fossett doubling his own previous record) and was called ''Solo Spirit'' after Lindbergh's ''[[Spirit of St. Louis]]''.&lt;ref name="stanfordalumni"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stlpostdispatch"/&gt; Fossett slept an average of two hours a night for the six-day journey, conducted in below-zero temperatures. After taking too much fuel to cross the Atlantic Ocean and circling [[Libya]] for 12 hours while officials decided whether or not to allow him into their airspace, Fossett did not have enough fuel to finish the flight. That year, Fossett flew farther for less money than better-financed expeditions (including one supported by Richard Branson) in part due to his ability to fly in an unpressurized capsule, a result of his heavy physical training at high altitudes.&lt;ref name="stanfordalumni"/&gt; The ''Solo Spirit'' capsule was put on display at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum across from the ''[[Apollo 11]]'' command module.&lt;ref name="stanfordalumni"/&gt;

==Scouting==
Fossett grew up in [[Garden Grove, California]] and earned the Eagle Scout award in 1957. He credited his experience in Scouting as a foundation for much of his later success. "As a Scout, I learned how to set goals and achieve them," he once said. "Being a Scout also taught me leadership at a young age when there are few opportunities to be a leader. Scouting values have remained with me throughout my life, in my business career, and now as I take on new challenges."&lt;ref name="Eagletter Winter 2007"/&gt; In his later years, he was described as a "legend" by fellow Scouts.&lt;ref name="jacksonsun"&gt;{{cite news  | last =Beadle

He later became a member of the BSA National Executive Board, and in 2007, Fossett succeeded Secretary of Defense [[Robert Gates]] as president of the [[National Eagle Scout Association]]. Fossett previously had served on the [[World Scout Committee]].&lt;ref name="airportjournal"/&gt;

Fossett was honored with the [[Distinguished Eagle Scout Award]] in 1992. In 1999 he received the [[Silver Buffalo Award]], BSA's highest recognition of service to youth.&lt;ref name=boyscoutsPR/&gt;

==Awards and honors==

In 2002, Fossett received aviation's highest award, the Gold Medal of the [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] (FAI) and in July 2007, he was inducted into the [[National Aviation Hall of Fame|Aviation Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name="telegraphJune2007"/&gt; He was presented at the ceremony by [[Dick Rutan]].

In 1997, Fossett was inducted into the Balloon and Airship Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name="airportjournal"/&gt; In February 2002, Fossett was named America's [[Rolex]] Yachtsman of the Year by the [[American Sailing Association]] at the [[New York Yacht Club]].&lt;ref name="yachtsman"/&gt; He was the oldest recipient of the award in its 41-year history, and the only recipient to fly himself to the ceremony in his own plane.&lt;ref name="yachtsman"/&gt;

He received the Explorers Medal from the [[Explorers Club]] following his solo balloon circumnavigation. He was given the Diplôme de Montgolfier by the [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] in 1996. He received the [[Harmon Trophy]], given annually "to the world's outstanding aviator and aeronaut", in 1998 and 2002. He received the Grande Médaille of the [[Aéro-Club de France]], and the British [[Royal Aero Club]]'s Gold Medal in 2002. He received the [[Order of Magellan]] and the [[French Republic]]'s [[Médaille de l'Aéronautique]] in 2003.&lt;ref name="airportjournal"/&gt;

===Disappearance and search===
[[File:Champion 8kcab super decathlon g-ezpz arp.jpg|thumb|right|Champion 8KCAB Super Decathlon]]
At 8:45 a.m. on the morning of Monday, September 3, 2007 (Labor Day), Fossett took off in a single-engine [[American Champion Decathlon|Super Decathlon]] light aircraft from the [[Flying-M Ranch]] private airstrip ({{Coord|38|36|13|N|119|00|11|W|type:airport_region:US-NV_scale:10000|name=Flying-M Ranch}}), near [[Smith Valley, Nevada]].

When he failed to return, searches were launched about six hours later. The aircraft had [[Aircraft registration|tail number]] {{Airreg|N|240R}} registered to the "Flying M Hunting Club, Inc." There was no signal from the plane's [[Emergency position-indicating radiobeacon station|emergency locator transmitter]] (ELT) designed to be automatically activated in the event of a crash, but it was of an older type notorious for failing to operate after a crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-09-05-fossett_N.htm?csp=34 |title=Fossett search stresses need for new beacons  |access-date = September 8, 2007 |author=Levin, Alan |date= September 6, 2007 | work=USA Today|publisher= Gannett |pages= |quote=The small plane piloted by Fossett, 63, was equipped with an older emergency beacon that is notorious for failing to operate after crashes, according to federal safety officials and the agencies that monitor the emergency beacons.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

It was first thought that Fossett may have also been wearing a [[Breitling SA|Breitling]] Emergency watch with a manually operated ELT that had a range of up to {{convert|90|mi|km}}, but no signal was received from it. On September 13, Fossett's wife, Peggy, issued a statement clarifying that he owned such a watch but was not wearing it when he took off for the Labor Day flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/05/AR2007090502116.html|title=Rescue Crews Find No Sign of Missing Adventurer |access-date = September 8, 2007 |author= Geis, Sonya|date= September 6, 2007 | work=[[The Washington Post]] |quote=In a telephone interview, [Fossett's friend Granger] Whitelaw said Fossett always wears a Swiss-made Breitling watch with the same type of electronic location transmitter that commercial jets use to alert rescuers when they crash.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnnstory4"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/09/13/fossett/index.html?iref=mpstoryview |title= Search for Fossett could solve decades-old mysteries |access-date = September 13, 2007 |date= September 13, 2007 | work=[[CNN]] |quote=Fossett's wife, Peggy, issued a statement Thursday in response to questions about whether her husband was wearing a watch with an emergency transmitter on his flight.

Fossett took off with enough fuel for four to five hours of flight, according to spokesperson Major Cynthia S. Ryan, Public Information Officer with the [[Civil Air Patrol]] (CAP).&lt;ref name="CNN4 – September 07"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Searchers with CAP were told that Fossett had gone out for a short flight over favorite territory, possibly including the areas of Lucky Boy Pass and Walker Lake. At one point it was suggested that he might have been out scouting for potential sites to conduct a planned land speed run.&lt;ref name="CNN4 – September 07" /&gt;
A [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) spokesperson noted that Fossett apparently did not file a [[flight plan]] and was not required to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chereb|first =Sandra|title =Adventurer Steve Fossett's Plane Missing|agency=Associated Press|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/04/AR2007090401945_pf.html|date=September 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,,2162338,00.html|title=Steve Fossett reported missing by US aviation authorities|date=September 4, 2007| work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the second day, Civil Air Patrol aircraft searched but found no trace of wreckage after initiating a complex and expanding search of what would later evolve into a nearly {{convert|20000|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} area of some of the most rugged terrain in North America. The search presented a severe challenge from the standpoint of safely flying hundreds of hours in very difficult conditions. On the first day of CAP searching, operations were suspended by mid-day due to high winds, according to Ryan. By the fourth day, the CAP was using fourteen aircraft in the search effort, including one equipped with the [[Airborne Real-time Cueing Hyperspectral Enhanced Reconnaissance|ARCHER]] system that could automatically scan detailed imaging for a given signature of the missing aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story.jsp?id=news/Foss09067.xml&amp;headline=Advanced%20Recon%20System%20Aids%20Fossett%20Search&amp;channel=null|title= Advanced Recon System Aids Fossett Search |access-date = September 8, 2007 |author= Fiorino, Frances |date=September 2007  | work=[[Aviation Week]]|publisher= McGraw-Hill |quote=According to CAP, a set of parameters describing the intended target, including its color and shape, is programmed into the ARCHER system.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By September 10, search crews had found eight previously unidentified crash sites,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/09/10/MNF0S2BJT.DTL |title=Search for Fossett turns up wrecks of 8 other small planes |access-date = September 10, 2007 | last=Friess | first=Steve |date=September 10, 2007 | work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |publisher=Hearst Communications Inc. |pages= A–1  |quote=The search for Fossett across a {{convert|17000|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} swath of the Sierra Nevada has revealed the wreckage of eight other small planes&amp;nbsp;...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-09-10-fossett_N.htm| title = Searchers frustrated over Fossett search | access-date = September 14, 2007 |date = September 10, 2007| agency=Associated Press | work=[[USA Today]]|quote=...search parties have spotted wreckage of eight other airplanes that had been lost for years in and around the rugged mountains of western Nevada.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All told, about two dozen aircraft were involved in the massive search, operating from the primary search base at Minden, Nevada, with a secondary search base located at Bishop, California. CAP searchers came from Wings across the United States, including Nevada, Utah, California, Arizona, New Mexico, Idaho, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Texas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/09/08/fossett.ap/index.html {{Dead link|date=October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 7, [[Google|Google Inc.]] helped the search for the aviator through its connections to contractors that provide [[satellite imagery]] for its [[Google Earth]] software. [[Richard Branson]], a British billionaire and friend of Fossett, said he and others were coordinating efforts with Google to see if any of the high-resolution images might include Fossett's aircraft.

On September 8, the first of a series of new high-resolution imagery from [[DigitalGlobe]] was made available via the [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]] beta website so that users could flag potential areas of interest for searching, in what is known as [[crowdsourcing]]. By September 11, up to 50,000 people had joined the effort, scrutinizing more than 300,000 278-square-foot squares of the imagery. Peter Cohen of Amazon believed that by September 11, the entire search area had been covered at least once. Amazon's search effort was shut down the week of October 29, without any measurable success.&lt;ref name="wired 11 sept"&gt;[https://www.wired.com/software/webservices/news/2007/09/distributed_search 50,000 Volunteers Join Distributed Search For Steve Fossett], [[Wired (magazine)#Website|Wired News]], By Steve Friess, September 11, 2007, 2:00 p.m.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WiredNov6"&gt;{{cite web | title=Online Fossett Searchers Ask, Was It Worth It? | last=Friess | first=Steve | work=Wired | url=http://archive.wired.com/techbiz/it/news/2007/11/fossett_search  | date=November 6, 2007  | access-date=July 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Major Cynthia Ryan later said it had been more of a hindrance than a help.&lt;ref name="WiredNov6" /&gt; She said that persons purporting to have seen the aircraft on the Mechanical Turk or have special knowledge clogged her email during critical days of the search, and for even months afterward. Many of the ostensible sightings proved to be images of CAP aircraft flying search grids, or simply mistaken artifacts of old images. Psychics flooded the search base in Minden with predictions of where the aviator could be found. Ryan got the majority of these calls personally, often at her home, in the middle of the night. One man from Canada was particularly persistent with daily calls to Ryan, interfering with her press briefings. Ryan asked her Incident Commander to issue a cease and desist order, backed up by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) if necessary. Ryan noted that every message, letter, or phone call was taken seriously, which swamped the USAF specialists assigned the task of reviewing every one of them without regard to apparent plausibility. In retrospect, the crowdsource effort was "not ready for prime time", according to Ryan.

On September 12, survival experts speculated that Fossett was likely to be dead.&lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/09/12/fossett.search.ap/index.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912203918/http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/09/12/fossett.search.ap/index.html | title=Survival experts doubt Fossett is still alive | date=September 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Steve Fossett likely dead, survival experts say", http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20732023/&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 17, the Nevada Wing of the Civil Air Patrol said it was suspending all flights in connection with its search operations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.check-six.com/lib/Famous_Missing/Fossett.htm |title=Missing – Steve Fossett |publisher=Check-Six.com |access-date=July 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but National Guard search flights, private search flights and ground searches continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/09/18/fossett.search.ap/index.html | title=Search for aviator scaled back | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113161526/http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/09/18/fossett.search.ap/index.html | archivedate=November 13, 2007 | date=September 18, 2007 | access-date=February 23, 2015 | work=CNN}}&lt;!-- No useful content in archived version. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 19, 2007, authorities confirmed they would stop actively looking for Fossett in the Nevada Desert, but would keep air crews on standby to fly to possible crash sites.

On May 1, 2008, the ''[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]'' attributed to Nevada State Governor [[Jim Gibbons (American politician)|Jim Gibbons']] spokesman, Ben Kieckhefer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Governor appoints ben kieckhefer press secretary |publisher=Office of the Governor, Nevada State |date=March 12, 2008 |url=http://gov.state.nv.us/PressReleases/2008/2008-03-12BenKieckhefer-PS.htm |access-date=May 1, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107061058/http://www.gov.state.nv.us/PressReleases/2008/2008-03-12BenKieckhefer-PS.htm |archivedate=January 7, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Governor's decision to direct the state to charge Steve Fossett's family for the $687,000 expense of the search for Fossett.&lt;ref name="earlycharge_report"&gt;{{cite news |last = Vogel |first = Ed  |title = MISSING ADVENTURER: Gibbons to bill Fossett widow |publisher = Las Vegas Review-Journal |date = May 1, 2008 |url = http://www.lvrj.com/news/18443319.html |quote = Government's cost to hunt for multimillionaire was $687,000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kieckhefer later played that early report down, when he told the ''Tahoe Daily Tribune'' that Nevada did not intend to demand an involuntary payment from Fossett's widow, but that such a payment would be voluntary: "We are going to request that they help offset some of these expenses, considering the scope of the search, the overall cost as well as our ongoing budget difficulties."&lt;ref name="laterdownplay"&gt;{{cite news |last= Chereb |first= Sandra |title= Nevada governor to ask Fossett widow for search money |work= Associated Press Writer |publisher= Tahoe Daily Tribune |date= May 1, 2008 |url= http://www.tahoedailytribune.com/article/20080501/NEWS01/925589792 |quote= Kieckhefer said any assistance from the Fossett family would be voluntary. |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110928105822/http://www.tahoedailytribune.com/article/20080501/NEWS01/925589792 |archivedate= September 28, 2011 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hotelier [[Barron Hilton]], from whose ranch Fossett had departed on the day he went missing, had previously volunteered $200,000 to help pay for the search costs.&lt;ref name="earlycharge_report" /&gt;&lt;ref name="laterdownplay" /&gt;

In his later comments to the ''Tahoe Daily Tribune'', Kieckhefer denied outright that a bill for the family was being prepared, and he said, "It will probably be in the form of a letter",&lt;ref name="laterdownplay" /&gt; which Kieckhefer indicated would include a financial outline of the steps taken by the state, the associated costs, and a mention of the state's ongoing budget difficulties.&lt;ref name="laterdownplay" /&gt;

Days prior to this announcement, state Emergency Management Director Frank Siracusa noted that "there is no precedent where government will go after people for costs just because they have money to pay for it. You get lost, and we look for you. It is a service your taxpayer dollars pay for",&lt;ref name="earlycharge_report" /&gt; although he conceded that legally any decision would rest with Gibbons. At an April 10, 2008 Legislature's Interim Finance Committee hearing, Siracusa indicated that he had hired an independent auditor to review costs incurred by the state in searching for Fossett, but added, "We are doing an audit but not because we are critical of anybody or suspect something was done wrong".&lt;ref name="earlycharge_report" /&gt;&lt;ref name="agendaminutes"&gt;{{cite web| work=Interim Finance Committee (NRS 218.6825) |publisher = Nevada Legislature| title = Agendas and Minutes |date = April 10, 2008 | url = https://www.leg.state.nv.us/74th/Interim/Scheduler/committeeIndex.cfm?ID=10091}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chairman Morse Arberry queried Siracusa as to why, since they lacked funds, had the state not billed the Fossett family for its search costs, to which Siracusa did not directly respond.&lt;ref name="earlycharge_report" /&gt;&lt;ref name="agendaminutes" /&gt; In his later interview with the Las Vegas Review-Journal, he stated that his comments to the Committee may have given the false impression that he had hired an auditor for the purpose of later challenging the state's financial burden incurred on its behalf by the National Guard during the search operation.&lt;ref name="earlycharge_report" /&gt; Upon interview regarding reports that the state would seek payment, Arberry was recorded as stating that he was glad to hear steps were being taken to try to recoup some of the costs.&lt;ref name="laterdownplay" /&gt;

The Nevada search cost $1.6 million, "the largest search and rescue effort ever conducted for a person within the U.S."  Jim Gibbons asked Fossett's estate to shoulder $487,000, but it declined, saying Fossett's wife had already spent $1 million on private searching.&lt;ref name="arizonadailystar"&gt;{{cite news | title =Audit critical of Nevada search for Steve Fossett | publisher =Arizona Daily Star | date =June 26, 2008 | url =http://www.azstarnet.com/sn/printDS/245620 | access-date =September 10, 2008 | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20081005163721/http://www.azstarnet.com/sn/printDS/245620 &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; | archivedate =October 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recovery of wreckage and remains===
On September 29, 2008, a hiker found three crumpled identification cards in the Eastern [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] in California about {{convert|65|mi|-1}} south (186 degrees) of Fossett's take-off site. The items were confirmed as belonging to Fossett and included an [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]]-issued card, his [[Soaring Society of America]] membership card and $1,005 in cash.&lt;ref name="sfgate_confirmed_ids_found"&gt;{{cite news

On October 1, late in the day, air search teams spotted wreckage on the ground at [[Geographic coordinate system|coordinates]] {{Coord|37|40|2.8|N|119|08|0|W|type:landmark_scale:25000_region:US-CA|name=Steve Fossett Aircraft Crash Site|display=inline}} at an elevation of {{convert|10100|ft|m}} and about {{convert|750|yd|-1}} from where the personal items had been found. Later that evening the teams confirmed identification of the [[Aircraft registration|tail number]] of Fossett's plane. The crash site is on a slope beneath the southwest side of a ridge line ({{convert|600|ft|m|-1}} lower than the top of the ridge) in the [[Ansel Adams Wilderness]] in [[Madera County, California]]. Other named places near the crash site include Minaret Mine ({{convert|2000|ft|m|-2}} west), Emily Lake ({{convert|0.7|mi|km|1}} northeast), [[Minaret Lake]] ({{convert|1.8|mi|km|1}} west-southwest), the [[Minarets (California)|Minaret peaks]] ({{convert|3|mi|0}} west), [[Devils Postpile National Monument]] ({{convert|4.5|mi|km|1}} southeast), and the town of [[Mammoth Lakes, California|Mammoth Lakes]] (the nearest populated place, {{convert|9|mi|km|0}} east-southeast).

On October 29, search teams recovered two large human bones that they suspected might belong to Fossett. These bones were found {{convert|0.5|mi|km}} east of the crash site.&lt;ref name="bbc-bones"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7707397.stm|title=Bones confirm Steve Fossett death|publisher=BBC News|date=November 3, 2008|access-date=November 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=November 3, 2008|title=DNA links bones near plane crash site to Fossett |author=Associated Press |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-11-03-3668149862_x.htm |newspaper=USA Today |access-date=March 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tennis shoes with animal bite marks on them were also recovered. On November 3, California police coroners said that [[DNA profiling]] of the two bones by a California Department of Justice forensics laboratory confirmed a match to Fossett's DNA. Madera County Sheriff John Anderson said Fossett would have died on impact in such a crash, and that it was not unusual for animals to drag remains away.&lt;ref name="bbc-bones" /&gt;

===NTSB report and findings===
On March 5, 2009, the NTSB issued its report and findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ntsb.gov/ntsb/brief2.asp?ev_id=20081007X17184&amp;ntsbno=SEA07FA277&amp;akey=1 |title=National Transportation Safety Board Report |publisher=Ntsb.gov |id=SEA07FA277 |access-date=July 18, 2010 |postscript={{inconsistent citations}} |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714203049/http://www.ntsb.gov/ntsb/brief2.asp?ev_id=20081007X17184&amp;ntsbno=SEA07FA277&amp;akey=1 |archivedate=July 14, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Factual Report – Aviation |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/ntsb/GenPDF.asp?id=SEA07FA277&amp;rpt=fa|publisher=National Transportation Safety Board |id=SEA07FA277|date=July 9, 2009|access-date=July 9, 2010|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; It states that the plane crashed at an elevation of about {{convert|10000|ft|m}}, {{convert|300|ft|m|-1}} below the crest of the ridge. The elevation of peaks in the area exceeded {{convert|13000|ft|m}}. However, the [[density altitude]] in the area at the time and place of the crash was estimated to be {{convert|12700|ft|m}}. The aircraft, a tandem two-seater, was nearly 30 years old and Fossett had flown approximately 40 hours in this type. The plane's operating manual says that at an altitude of {{convert|13000|ft|m}} the [[rate of climb]] would be 300 feet per minute (about 1.5&amp;nbsp;m/s). The NTSB report says that "a meteorologist from [[Salinas, California|Salinas]] provided a numerical simulation of the conditions in the accident area using the WRF-ARW (Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting) numerical model. At 0930 [the approximate time of the crash] the model displayed downdrafts in that area of approximately 300 feet per minute." There was no evidence of equipment failure. The report stated that a postmortem examination of the skeletal fragments had been performed under the auspices of the Madera County Sheriff's Department. The cause of death was determined to be multiple traumatic injuries. The ELT was destroyed by the crash.

On July 9, 2009, the NTSB declared the probable cause of the crash as "the pilot's inadvertent encounter with downdrafts that exceeded the climb capability of the airplane. Contributing to the accident were the downdrafts, high [[density altitude]], and mountainous terrain."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=National Transportation Safety Board|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/brief2.aspx?ev_id=20081007X17184&amp;ntsbno=SEA07FA277&amp;akey=1|title=SEA07FA277: Full Narrative|date=July 9, 2009|access-date=July 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/07/09/fossett.crash.cause/index.html |title=Investigators: Strong winds probable cause of Fossett crash |publisher=CNN.com |date= July 9, 2009|access-date=April 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Watts Young''' (September 24, 1930&amp;nbsp;– January 5, 2018) was an American [[astronaut]], [[United States Navy|naval officer]] and [[United States Naval Aviator|aviator]], [[test pilot]], and [[aerospace engineering|aeronautical engineer]]. He became the [[List of Apollo astronauts#People who have walked on the Moon|ninth person to walk on the Moon]] as Commander of the [[Apollo 16]] mission in 1972. Young enjoyed the longest career of any astronaut, becoming the first person to fly six space missions (with seven launches, counting his lunar liftoff) over the course of 42 years of active [[NASA]] service.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/young.html |title=Biographical Data: John W.

In 1965, Young flew on the [[Gemini 3|first manned Gemini mission]], and commanded another Gemini mission the next year. In 1969 during [[Apollo 10]], he became the first person to fly solo around the Moon.&lt;ref name="nasa200412007"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/vision/space/features/young_retires.html |title=From Gemini to Shuttle: John Young Retires |publisher=NASA |date=December 7, 2004 |access-date=January 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He drove the [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]] on the [[Moon]]'s surface during [[Apollo 16]], and is one of only three people to have [[List of Apollo astronauts|flown to the Moon]] twice.&lt;ref name="npr20180106"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/01/16/505928876/gene-cernan-last-man-to-walk-on-the-moon-dies-at-82 |title=Gene Cernan, Last Man To Walk On The Moon, Dies At 82 |publisher=NPR |last1=Lewis |first1=Russell |date=January 6, 2018 |access-date=January 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also commanded two Space Shuttle flights, including [[STS-1|its first launch]] in 1981, and served as [[Chief of the Astronaut Office]] from 1974 to 1987. Young retired from NASA in 2004. He died on January 5, 2018.

==Biography==

===Early years and education===
Young was born in [[San Francisco, California]], on September 24, 1930, to parents William Hugh Young, a civil engineer,&lt;ref name="nyt20180106"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/06/obituaries/john-young-dead.html |title=John Young, Who Led First Space Shuttle Mission, Dies at 87 |work=[[The New York Times]] |first=Richard |last=Goldstein |date=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Wanda Howland Young.&lt;ref name="navy-history-young"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/biographies-list/bios-y/Young-John/Young-John-Text.html |title=John Watts Young |publisher=Navy Office of Information, Biographies Branch |date=April 10, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 18 months old, due to the [[Great Depression]], he moved with his family to [[Cartersville, Georgia|Cartersville]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]],&lt;ref name="fortune20180106"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://amp.timeinc.net/fortune/2018/01/06/astronaut-john-young-dead |title=Astronaut John Young, One of Only 12 to Walk on Moon, Dies at 87 |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |agency=[[Bloomberg News]] |date=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; then to [[Orlando, Florida]], where he attended grade school and later [[Orange County Public Schools#High schools|Orlando High School]] until graduating in 1948.&lt;ref name="sjg19650324"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HhpdAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1598%2C4411712 |title=John Young, as Early as 1946, Displayed Interest in Rockets |work=[[St. Joseph Gazette]] |author=Associated Press |volume=120 |issue=238 |page=6A |date=March 24, 1965 |access-date=May 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jwy-edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.johnwyoung.org/bio/education.htm |title=Biography: Education |work=JohnWYoung.org |access-date=May 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young was a [[Boy Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Boy Scout]] and earned the rank of [[Ranks in the Boy Scouts of America#Second Class|Second Class]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scouting.org/About/FactSheets/scouting_space.aspx |title=Scouting and Space Exploration |website=Scouting.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000000/http://www.scouting.org/About/FactSheets/scouting_space.aspx |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young earned a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree with highest honors in [[Aerospace engineering|Aeronautical Engineering]] from the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] in 1952; while attending, he became a member of the national military honor society [[Scabbard and Blade]] and [[Sigma Chi]] fraternity.&lt;ref name="fw4465"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1774&amp;dat=19650404&amp;id=AZscAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wmUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5001,1212947 |title=Virgil Grissom and John Young: Our Trail-Blazing "Twin" Astronauts |work=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]] |series=Family Weekly |first=John W. |last=Wasik |page=4 |date=April 4, 1965 |access-date=January 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="blueprint1952"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://hdl.handle.net/1853/25833 |title=Blue Print |publisher=[[Georgia Institute of Technology]] |editor-first=Blount |editor-last=Boswell |volume=45 |page=108 |date=1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Navy service===
{{quote box|align=right|width=28%|quote=I got a telegram from the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] asking me not to do this anymore.|salign=right|source=— Young, describing an air-to-air missile test in which he and another pilot approached each other at Mach 3 - risking destruction of both aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.johnwyoung.org/bio/navycareer.htm |title=Astronaut John W. Young - Navy Career |website=Johnwyoung.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
After graduating from [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] in 1952, Young entered the [[United States Navy]] through the [[Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps|Navy ROTC]] and was commissioned on June 6, 1952, as an [[ensign (rank)|ensign]].&lt;ref name="navy-history-young" /&gt; He served as fire control officer on the destroyer {{USS|Laws|DD-558|6}} until June 1953 and completed a tour in the [[Sea of Japan]] during the [[Korean War]]. Following this assignment, he was sent to flight training. In January 1954, he was designated a Navy helicopter pilot.&lt;ref name="navy-history-young" /&gt; After receiving his [[United States Naval Aviator|aviator wings]] on December 20, 1954, he was assigned to Fighter Squadron 103 ([[VFA-103|VF-103]]) for four years, flying [[Grumman F9F Cougar]]s from {{USS|Coral Sea|CV-43|6}} and [[Vought F8U Crusader]]s from {{USS|Forrestal|CV-59|6}}.&lt;ref name="nmmuseum" /&gt;

After training at the [[United States Naval Test Pilot School]] in 1959 with the Class 23, Young was assigned to the Naval Air Test Center at [[Naval Air Station Patuxent River]], Maryland, for three years. His test projects included evaluations of the [[Vought XF8U-3 Crusader III|XF8U-3 Crusader III]] and [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4 Phantom II]] fighter weapons systems. In 1962, he set two world time-to-climb records while flying his Phantom II, attaining {{convert|3000|m|ft|0|sp=us}} from a standing start in 34.52 seconds and {{convert|25000|m|ft|0|sp=us}} from a standing start in 227.6 seconds.&lt;ref name="navy-history-young" /&gt; He also served as maintenance officer of Fighter Squadron 143 ([[VFA-143|VF-143]]) from April to September 1962.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

Fellow astronaut [[Charles Bolden]] described Young and [[Robert L. Gibson|Robert "Hoot" Gibson]] as the two best pilots he had met during his aviation career: "Never met two people like them. Everyone else gets into an airplane; John and Hoot wear their airplane. They're just awesome".&lt;ref name="bolden20040106"&gt;{{cite interview |title=Charles F.

===NASA career===
====Project Gemini====

[[Image:John Young is hiosted into helicopter after Gemini 10 flight 1966.jpg|right|thumb|Young following splashdown of Gemini 10]]
Joining [[NASA]] in 1962, Young was the first of the [[NASA Astronaut Group 2|Astronaut Group 2]] to fly in space, replacing [[Thomas P. Stafford]] as pilot of [[Gemini 3]] when [[Alan Shepard]], the original command pilot, was grounded due to [[Ménière's disease]].{{sfn|Thompson|2004|p=366}} Making the first manned flight of the Gemini spacecraft with [[Gus Grissom]] in 1965, Young scored another space first by smuggling a corned beef sandwich onto the spacecraft—a feat for which he was reprimanded. Some members of the US House of Representatives were not pleased about the stunt, claiming that Young cost tax payers millions of dollars by disrupting a scheduled test of space food during the flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://gizmodo.com/50-years-ago-nasa-astronauts-smuggled-a-corned-beef-sa-1693431694 |title=50 Years Ago, NASA Astronauts Smuggled a Corned Beef Sandwich Into Space |work=Gizmodo |last1=Zhang |first1=Sarah |date=March 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/mission_trans/GT03_TEC.PDF |title=Composite Air-to-ground and Onboard Voice Tape Transcription of the GT-3 Mission |publisher=National Astronautics and Space Administration |page=45 |date=April 1965 |access-date=May 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young then trained as backup pilot for [[Gemini 6A]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_1010.html |title=Gemini 6 Back-up Crew |publisher=NASA |date=March 23, 2008 |access-date=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assignment of [[Gemini 7]] backup command pilot [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]] to Apollo, created an opening for Young as commander of [[Gemini 10]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MYasNyKQIxMC&amp;pg=PA151&amp;lpg=PA151 |title=Foothold in the Heavens: The Seventies |series=A History of Human Space Exploration |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]] |last1=Evans |first1=Ben |page=151 |date=August 14, 2010 |isbn=978-1-4419-6341-3 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4419-6342-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission was the first to perform a rendezvous with two [[Agena target vehicle]]s; and his pilot, [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]], performed two spacewalks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.space.com/37527-gemini-10-photos.html |title=Gemini 10: NASA's Epic 1st Double Rendezvous Mission in Photos |work=Space.com |last1=Lunsford |first1=Christine |date=September 18, 2017 |access-date=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?sc=1966-066A |title=Gemini 10 |publisher=NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive |access-date=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Apollo program====

In 1966, Young was assigned to an Apollo crew as [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command Module]] pilot, with Commander [[Thomas P. Stafford|Thomas Stafford]] and [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] pilot [[Eugene Cernan]]. This crew was assigned as backup to the second manned Apollo mission, planned before the [[Apollo 1]] fire. After that fire, both crews were assigned to the first actual manned mission, [[Apollo 7]], which flew in October 1968.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; In May 1969, this crew flew to the Moon on [[Apollo 10]]. While Stafford and Cernan flew the Lunar Module in lunar orbit for the first time, Young flew the Command Module solo. Apollo 10 set the record for the highest speed attained by any manned vehicle at {{convert|39897|km/h|mph}} during its return to Earth on May 26, 1969.&lt;ref name="Guinness2012"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=biWfNzQiR8EC&amp;pg=PA322 |title=Guinness World Records 2012 |publisher=[[Bantam Books]] |editor-first=Craig |editor-last=Glenday |page=322 |date=2012 |isbn=978-0-345-53437-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lloyd2010"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uCgRY6llQpYC&amp;pg=PA280 |title=QI: The Book of General Ignorance |publisher=[[Faber and Faber]] |first1=John |last1=Lloyd |first2=John |last2=Mitchinson |edition=The Noticeably Stouter |page=280 |date=2010 |isbn=978-0-571-27378-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young was backup commander of [[Apollo 13]], the troubled mission in which the Moon landing was aborted because of an explosion in the Service Module.&lt;ref name="backup"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://airandspace.si.edu/explore-and-learn/topics/apollo/apollo-program/landing-missions/apollo13-crew.cfm |title=Apollo 13 Crew |publisher=Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum |access-date=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By rotation, Young became commander of [[Apollo 16]], and studied [[geology]] with his crew while preparing for the mission.&lt;ref name=sudburytraining&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=s-9UAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kjwNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1178,849265&amp;dq=apollo+16+training&amp;hl=en |title=Astronauts training in Ont. |agency=[[The Canadian Press]] |newspaper=[[Leader-Post|The Leader-Post]] |location=Regina, Saskatchewan |last=Dickie |first=Allan |date=July 7, 1971 |accessdate=November 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo 16's lunar landing was almost aborted when a malfunction was detected in the SPS engine control system in the Service Module. It was determined that the problem could be worked around, and the mission continued.&lt;ref name=overview&gt;{{cite web |title=Descartes Surprise |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.summary.html |publisher=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal |accessdate=November 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the surface, Young took three moonwalks in the [[Descartes Highlands]] with [[Charles Duke]] on April 21, 22 and 23, 1972, making Young the ninth person to walk on the surface of the Moon, while [[Ken Mattingly]] flew the Command Module in lunar orbit.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/missions/apollo16.html |title=Apollo 16 |date=July 8, 2009 |publisher=NASA |access-date=January 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young's final assignment in Apollo was as the backup commander for Cernan on [[Apollo 17]]. The backup crew was originally the [[Apollo 15]] crew, but [[Deke Slayton]] removed them from the assignment when he learned they had taken a small statue to the moon, as well as stamps that they sold to a dealer.&lt;ref name=15backup&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kAsUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=94oDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5667,8302&amp;dq=apollo+17+backup+crew&amp;hl=en |title=Apollo crew warned about commercialism |newspaper=The Free Lance-Star |date=August 1, 1972 |accessdate=August 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nasmcrew&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasm.si.edu/collections/imagery/apollo/as17/a17crew.htm |title=Apollo 17 Crew |work=The Apollo Program |publisher=[[National Air and Space Museum]] |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=August 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Space Shuttle program====

[[Image:John Young 2006.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Young at the 25th anniversary of STS-1 at [[Kennedy Space Center]]]]
In January 1973 Young was made Chief of the Space Shuttle Branch of the Astronaut Office. In January 1974, he became Chief of the Astronaut Office after the retirement of [[Alan Shepard]].&lt;ref name="asf"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://astronautscholarship.org/Astronauts/john-w-young/ |title=John Young |publisher=Astronaut Scholarship Foundation |access-date=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young flew two missions of the Space Shuttle, both aboard the {{OV|Columbia}}. He commanded the program's 1981 maiden orbital flight, [[STS-1]], and in 1983 commanded [[STS-9]], which carried the first [[Spacelab]] module.&lt;ref name="asf" /&gt; In 1986 he was in line to make a record seventh space flight on [[Canceled Space Shuttle missions#Canceled due to the Challenger disaster|STS-61-J]] to deploy the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], but the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' disaster]] earlier that year had delayed NASA's schedule.&lt;ref name="sts61"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/flights/sts61j.htm |title=STS-61-J |publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica |date=November 17, 2007 |accessdate=March 31, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108041720/http://astronautix.com/flights/sts61j.htm |archivedate=January 8, 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

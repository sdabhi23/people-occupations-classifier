Sullenberger was appointed to the [[United States Air Force Academy]], entering with the Class of 1973 in June 1969.

Following completion of his graduate degree at Purdue, he was assigned to UPT at [[Columbus AFB]], Mississippi, flying the [[T-37 Tweet]] and [[T-38 Talon]]. After earning his wings in 1975 as a [[U.S. Air Force aeronautical rating|USAF Pilot]], he completed replacement training in the [[F-4 Phantom II]] at [[Luke AFB]], Arizona.

The National Transportation Safety Board ruled that Sullenberger made the correct decision in landing on the river instead of attempting a return to LaGuardia&lt;ref&gt;Dodd, Johnny (September 19, 2016).

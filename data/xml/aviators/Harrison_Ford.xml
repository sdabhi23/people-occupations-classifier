Ford was active in the [[Boy Scouts of America]], and achieved its second-highest rank, Life Scout. He worked at [[Napowan Adventure Base]] Scout camp as a counselor for the Reptile Study merit badge. Because of this, he and director [[Steven Spielberg]] later decided to depict the young [[Indiana Jones]] as a Life Scout in the film ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]''.

In 1960, Ford graduated from [[Maine East High School]] in [[Park Ridge, Illinois]]. His was the first student voice broadcast on his high school's new radio station, [[WMTH]],&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; and he was its first sportscaster during his senior year (1959–60). He attended [[Ripon College (Wisconsin)|Ripon College]] in [[Wisconsin]],&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; where he was a philosophy major and a member of the [[Sigma Nu]] fraternity.

==Early career==
In 1964, after a season of [[Summer stock theatre|summer stock]] with the Belfry Players in Wisconsin,&lt;ref&gt;Franzene, Jessica, "Theologians &amp; Thespians," in Welcome Home, a realtors' guide to property history in the Lake Geneva region, August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Ford traveled to Los Angeles to apply for a job in radio voice-overs. He did not get it, but stayed in California and eventually signed a $150-a-week contract with [[Columbia Pictures]]' new talent program, playing bit roles in films. His first known role was an uncredited one as a bellhop in ''[[Dead Heat on a Merry-Go-Round]]'' (1966). There is little record of his non-speaking roles (or "extra" work) in film. Ford was at the bottom of the hiring list, having offended producer Jerry Tokovsky after he played a bellboy in the feature. He was told by Tokovsky that when actor [[Tony Curtis]] delivered a bag of groceries, he did it like a movie star; Ford felt his job was to act like a bellboy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=White |first=Dana |url=https://www.amazon.com/Harrison-Ford-Imperfect-Garry-Jenkins/dp/0735100896 |title=Harrison Ford: Imperfect Hero (9780735100893): Garry Jenkins: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=February 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford managed to secure other roles in movies, such as ''[[A Time for Killing|A Time for Killing (The Long Ride Home)]]'', starring [[Glenn Ford]], [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]], and [[Inger Stevens]].

His speaking roles continued next with ''[[Luv (film)|Luv]]'' (1967), though he was still uncredited. He was finally credited as "Harrison J. Ford" in the 1967 [[Western (genre)|Western]] film ''[[A Time for Killing]]'', but the "J" did not stand for anything, since he has no middle name. It was added to avoid confusion with [[Harrison Ford (silent film actor)|a silent film actor named Harrison Ford]], who appeared in more than 80 films between 1915 and 1932 and died in 1957. Ford later said that he was unaware of the existence of the earlier actor until he came upon a star with his own name on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. Ford soon dropped the "J" and worked for [[Universal Studios]], playing minor roles in many television series throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, including ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', ''[[Ironside (TV series)|Ironside]]'', ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'', ''[[The F.B.I. (TV series)|The F.B.I.]]'', ''[[Love, American Style]]'', and ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]''. He appeared in the western ''Journey to Shiloh'' (1968) and had an uncredited, non-speaking role in [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s 1970 film ''[[Zabriskie Point (film)|Zabriskie Point]]'' as an arrested student protester. French filmmaker [[Jacques Demy]] chose Ford for the lead role of his first American film, ''[[Model Shop (film)|Model Shop]]'' (released in 1969) but the head of Columbia Pictures thought Ford had "no future" in the film business and told Demy to hire a more experienced actor. The part eventually went to [[Gary Lockwood]]. Ford later commented that the experience had been nevertheless a positive one because Demy was the first to show such faith in him.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/09/movies/new-dvd-s-unknown-harrison-ford-with-no-future.html NEW DVD'S; Unknown Harrison Ford With No Future], ''The New York Times'', 9 December 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lefigaro.fr/cinema/2013/04/08/03002-20130408ARTFIG00281-harrison-ford-demy-avait-foi-en-moi.php Harrison Ford: «Jacques Demy avait foi en moi»], ''[[Le Figaro]]'', 8 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; 

Not happy with the roles being offered to him, Ford became a self-taught professional [[carpentry|carpenter]]&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; to support his then-wife and two young sons.

Casting director and fledgling producer [[Fred Roos]] championed the young Ford and secured him an audition with [[George Lucas]] for the role of Bob Falfa, which Ford went on to play in ''[[American Graffiti]]'' (1973).&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; Ford's relationship with Lucas would profoundly affect his career later on. After director [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s film ''[[The Godfather]]'' was a success, he hired Ford to expand his office and gave him small roles in his next two films, ''[[The Conversation]]'' (1974) and ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (1979); in the latter film he played an army officer named "G. Lucas".

==Milestone franchises==

===''Star Wars''===
Harrison Ford's previous work in ''American Graffiti'' eventually landed him his first starring film role, when he was hired by Lucas to read lines for actors auditioning for roles in his then-upcoming film ''Star Wars'' (1977).&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; Lucas was eventually won over by Ford's performance during these line reads and cast him as Han Solo.&lt;ref&gt;Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy. Star Wars Trilogy Box Set DVD documentary. [2005]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Star Wars'' became one of the most successful movies of all time and established Ford as a superstar. He went on to star in the similarly successful ''Star Wars'' sequels, ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980) and ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983), as well as the ''[[Star Wars Holiday Special]]'' (1978). Ford wanted Lucas to [[kill off]] Han Solo at the end of ''Return of the Jedi'', saying, "That would have given the whole film a bottom," but Lucas refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=May 23, 2008|url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2006/03/02/harrison_ford_wanted_han_solo_to_die|title=Harrison Ford Wanted Han Solo to Die|work=Starpulse|date=March 2, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506212332/http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2006/03/02/harrison_ford_wanted_han_solo_to_die|archivedate=May 6, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ford reprised the role of Han Solo in the sequel ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' (2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://starwars.com/news/star-wars-episode-7-cast-announced.html|title=Star Wars: Episode VII Cast Announced|work=StarWars.com|date=April 29, 2014|accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During filming on June 11, 2014, Ford suffered what was said to be a fractured ankle, when a hydraulic door fell on him.

Ford's status as a leading actor was solidified when he starred as globe-trotting archeologist [[Indiana Jones]] in the film ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' (1981), a collaboration between George Lucas and Steven Spielberg.&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; Though Spielberg was interested in casting Ford from the beginning, Lucas was not, due to having already worked with the actor in ''American Graffiti'' and ''Star Wars'', but he eventually relented after [[Tom Selleck]] was unable to accept.&lt;ref name=tca/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(DVD) Indiana Jones: Making the Trilogy. Paramount Pictures. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford went on to star in the prequel ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'' (1984) and the sequel ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' (1989).&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; He returned to the role yet again for a 1993 episode of the television series ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'', and even later for the fourth film ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'' (2008).

==Other film work==
Ford has been in other films, including ''[[Heroes (1977 film)|Heroes]]'' (1977), ''[[Force 10 from Navarone (film)|Force 10 from Navarone]]'' (1978), and ''[[Hanover Street (film)|Hanover Street]]'' (1979). Ford also co-starred alongside [[Gene Wilder]] in the buddy-[[Western (genre)|Western]] ''[[The Frisco Kid]]'' (1979), playing a bank robber with a heart of gold. He then starred as [[Rick Deckard]] in [[Ridley Scott]]'s [[cult films|cult]] sci-fi classic ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982), and in a number of dramatic-action films: [[Peter Weir]]'s ''[[Witness (1985 film)|Witness]]'' (1985) and ''[[The Mosquito Coast]]'' (1986), and [[Roman Polanski]]'s ''[[Frantic (film)|Frantic]]'' (1988).&lt;ref name=tca/&gt;

The 1990s brought Ford the role of [[Jack Ryan (fictional character)|Jack Ryan]] in [[Tom Clancy]]'s ''[[Patriot Games (film)|Patriot Games]]'' (1992) and ''[[Clear and Present Danger]]'' (1994); as well as leading roles in [[Alan Pakula]]'s ''[[Presumed Innocent (film)|Presumed Innocent]]'' (1990) and ''[[The Devil's Own]]'' (1997); [[Andrew Davis (filmmaker)|Andrew Davis]]' ''[[The Fugitive (1993 film)|The Fugitive]] ''(1993); [[Sydney Pollack]]'s [[remake]] of ''[[Sabrina (1995 film)|Sabrina]] ''(1995); and [[Wolfgang Petersen]]'s ''[[Air Force One (film)|Air Force One]]'' (1997). Ford also played straight dramatic roles, including an adulterous husband in both ''[[Presumed Innocent (film)|Presumed Innocent]]'' (1990) and ''[[What Lies Beneath]]'' (2000), and a recovering amnesiac in [[Mike Nichols]]' ''[[Regarding Henry]]'' (1991).&lt;ref name=tca/&gt;

Many of Ford's major film roles came to him by default through unusual circumstances: he won the role of Han Solo while reading lines for other actors, was cast as Indiana Jones because Tom Selleck was not available, he also took over the role of Jack Ryan supposedly due to [[Alec Baldwin]]'s fee demands, Baldwin had previously played the role of Ryan in ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]''.

===1990s–2010s===
[[File:Harrison Ford Cannes.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Ford at the [[2008 Cannes Film Festival]]]]
Starting in the late 1990s, Ford appeared in several critically derided and commercially disappointing movies, including ''[[Six Days, Seven Nights]]'' (1998); ''[[Random Hearts]]'' (1999); ''[[K-19: The Widowmaker]]'' (2002); ''[[Hollywood Homicide]]'' (2003); ''[[Firewall (film)|Firewall]]'' (2006); and ''[[Extraordinary Measures]]'' (2010).

In 2004, Ford declined a chance to star in the thriller ''[[Syriana]]'', later commenting that "I didn't feel strongly enough about the truth of the material and I think I made a mistake."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=May 23, 2008 |url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2006/03/03/harrison_ford_regrets_passing_on_syriana |title=Harrison Ford Regrets Passing on 'Syriana' |publisher=Starpulse |date=March 3, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531064559/http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2006/03/03/harrison_ford_regrets_passing_on_syriana |archivedate=May 31, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The role eventually went to [[George Clooney]], who won an Oscar and a Golden Globe for his work. Prior to that, he had passed on a role in another [[Stephen Gaghan]]-written role, Robert Wakefield in ''[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic]]''. That role went to [[Michael Douglas]].

In 2008, Ford enjoyed success with the release of ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'', another Lucas/Spielberg collaboration. The film received generally positive reviews and was the second highest-grossing film worldwide in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=worldwide&amp;yr=2008&amp;p=.htm |title=2008 Worldwide Grosses |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=August 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later said he would like to star in another sequel, "...if it didn't take another 20 years to digest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=May 23, 2008 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3ied0764c52ea0c6b79e5a439cf257d65d |title=Can you dig it?

In July 2011, Ford starred alongside [[Daniel Craig]] and [[Olivia Wilde]] in the [[science fiction Western]] film ''[[Cowboys &amp; Aliens]]''. To promote the film, Ford appeared at the [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] and, apparently surprised by the warm welcome, told the audience, "I just wanted to make a living as an actor.

Other non-suitable sources talk about his being a passenger in a 2-seat F/A-18, which makes more sense, as he's probably not qualified on that type. A ride-along, even if we can find a decent source, it doesn't seem encyclopedic. — [[User:AlanM1]] 2014-03-03T08:53Z

====Incidents====
On October 23, 1999, Harrison Ford was involved in the crash of a [[Bell 206|Bell 206L4 LongRanger]] helicopter (N36R). The [[NTSB]] accident report states that Ford was piloting the aircraft over the [[Lake Piru]] riverbed near [[Santa Clarita, California|Santa Clarita]], California, on a routine training flight. While making his second attempt at an [[autorotation]] with powered recovery, Ford allowed the aircraft's altitude to drop to 150–200 feet&lt;!-- Is this altitude change correct? It's not in the NTSB report, but it says the FAA minimum is 8–10', depending on aircraft type. --&gt; before beginning power-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=AirSafe.com, LLC |url=http://www.airsafe.com/events/celebs/ford.htm |title=Helicopter Accident Involving Actor Harrison Ford |publisher=Airsafe.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft was unable to recover power before hitting the ground. The aircraft landed hard and began skidding forward in the loose gravel before one of its skids struck a partially embedded log, flipping the aircraft onto its side. Neither Ford nor the instructor pilot suffered any injuries, though the helicopter was seriously damaged. When asked about the incident by fellow pilot [[James Lipton]] in an interview on the TV show ''[[Inside the Actor's Studio]]'', Ford replied, "I broke it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=May 23, 2008 |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/aviationquery/brief.aspx?ev_id=20001212X19997&amp;key=1 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030515230949/http://www.ntsb.gov/ntsb/brief.asp?ev_id=20001212X19997&amp;key=1 |archivedate=May 15, 2003 |title=LAX00LA024 |publisher=[[National Transportation Safety Board]] |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 5, 2015, Ford's plane, believed to be a [[Ryan PT-22 Recruit]], made an [[emergency landing]] on the Penmar Golf Course in [[Venice, California]]. Ford had radioed in to report that the plane had experienced engine failure. He was taken to [[Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center]], where he was reported to be in fair to moderate condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blankstein|first=Andrew|title=Harrison Ford Reported Fair After Plane Crash|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/harrison-ford-injured-plane-crash-n318301 |website=NBC News |accessdate=5 March 2015|date=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford suffered a broken [[pelvis]] and broken ankle during the accident, as well as other injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dillon|first=Nancy|last2=Blidner|first2=Rachelle|title='My first instinct was to run to the airplane': Surgeon recalls moment he helped Harrison Ford after crash|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/harrison-ford-broke-pelvis-ankle-bones-report-article-1.2139614|newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]|accessdate=6 March 2015|date=March 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 13, 2017, Ford landed an [[Aviat Husky]] at [[John Wayne Airport]] on the taxiway left of runway 20L. A [[Boeing 737]] was holding short of the runway on the taxiway when Ford overflew them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schwebke|first1=Scott|title=Harrison Ford lands plane on taxiway instead of runway, flies over passenger jet at John Wayne Airport|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/ford-743999-nbc-incident.html|accessdate=February 14, 2017|publisher=[[The Orange County Register]]|date=February 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental causes===
Ford is vice-chair of [[Conservation International]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2013/04/29/harrison-ford-environmentalist/ |title=Harrison Ford: There are no great movies on global environmental issues |work=CNN |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502021322/http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2013/04/29/harrison-ford-environmentalist/ |archivedate=May 2, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; an American nonprofit [[environmental organization]] headquartered in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington, Virginia]]. The organization's intent is to protect [[nature]].&lt;ref name="aboutus"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.conservation.org/about/pages/about_us.aspx |title=About Us |publisher=Conservation International |accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institution tries to combine the services or benefits of science, field work, and partnership to find global solutions to global problems. Three ways CI goes about solving nature-related problems are: 1) identifying and moving to protect locations that are crucial, such as those affecting water, food, and air; 2) working with large companies that are involved in energy and agriculture, to ensure the environment is being protected; and 3) working with governments to ensure they have the knowledge and the proper tools to construct policies that are environmentally friendly.

From its origins as an NGO dedicated to protecting tropical biodiversity, CI has evolved into an organization that works with governments, scientists, charitable foundations, and business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanacademy.de/home/program/past/economics-nature |title=The Economics of Nature |website=American Academy |accessdate=February 3, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612045035/http://www.americanacademy.de/home/program/past/economics-nature |archivedate=June 12, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; CI has been criticised for links to companies with a poor environmental record such as [[BP]], [[Cargill]], [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]], [[Monsanto]] and [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] and for allegedly offering [[greenwashing]] services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theecologist.org/News/news_analysis/877241/conservation_international_agreed_to_greenwash_arms_company.html |title=Conservation International 'agreed to greenwash arms company' |website=The Ecologist |accessdate=August 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/wrong-kind-green |title=The Wrong Kind of Green |website=The Nation |date=March 4, 2010 |accessdate=August 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; CI has also been chastised for poor judgment in its expenditure of donors' money.

In September 2013, Ford, while filming an environmental documentary in [[Indonesia]], interviewed the Indonesian [[Forestry]] Minister, [[Zulkifli Hasan]]. After the interview the Presidential Advisor, Andi Arief, accused Ford and his crew of "harassing state institutions" and publicly threatened them with [[deportation]]. Questions within the interview concerned the [[Tesso Nilo National Park]], [[Sumatra]]. It was alleged the Minister of Forestry was given no prior warning of questions nor the chance to explain the challenges of catching people with [[illegal logging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-10/indonesian-minister-shocked-at-harrison-ford-climate-interview/4949316 |title=Harrison Ford Shocks Indonesian Minister with Heated Climate Interview |website=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=September 10, 2013 |accessdate=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity/harrison-ford-upsets-indonesian-minister-with-rude-interview-20130911-2tiwc.html |title=Harrison Ford Upsets Indonesian Minister with 'Rude' Interview |first=Michael |last=Bachelard |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=September 11, 2013 |accessdate=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/09/09/fm-bemoans-harrison-ford-s-attitude.html |title=FM Bemoans Harrison Ford’s Attitude |newspaper=The Jakarta Post |date=September 9, 2013 |accessdate=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/10/harrison-ford-environment-indonesia_n_3899141.html |title=Harrison Ford's Environment Documentary Questions 'Shocked' Indonesian Forestry Minister |website=Huffington Post |date=September 10, 2013 |accessdate=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford was provided an audience with the Indonesian President, [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]], during which he expressed concerns regarding Indonesia's environmental degradation and the government efforts to address climate change.

In 1993, the [[arachnology|arachnologist]] Norman Platnick named a new species of spider ''[[Calponia harrisonfordi]]'', and in 2002, the [[entomology|entomologist]] [[Edward O. Wilson]] named a new [[ant]] species ''[[Pheidole harrisonfordi]]'' (in recognition of Harrison's work as Vice Chairman of [[Conservation International]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=May 23, 2008|url=http://www.ourplanet.com/imgversn/142/ford.html|title=Harrison Ford|publisher=Our Planet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1992, Ford has lent his voice to a series of public service messages promoting environmental involvement for EarthShare, an American federation of environmental and conservation charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=December 27, 2017|url=http://www.earthshare.org/2008/10/earthshare-psa.html|title=EarthShare PSA: "Promises"|work=Earthshare |date=October 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford has been a spokesperson for [[Restore Hetch Hetchy]], a non-profit organization dedicated to restoring [[Yosemite National Park]]'s [[Hetch Hetchy Valley]] to its original condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=May 16, 2013 |url=http://www.hetchhetchy.org/educational-activities/46-discover-hetch-hetchy |title=Discover Hetch Hetchy with Harrison Ford Preview |publisher=Restore Hetch Hetchy |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119055037/http://www.hetchhetchy.org/educational-activities/46-discover-hetch-hetchy |archivedate=November 19, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford appears in the documentary series ''[[Years of Living Dangerously]]'', which provides reports on those affected by, and seeking solutions to, climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://yearsoflivingdangerously.com/ |title=Years Of Living Dangerously |work=yearsoflivingdangerously.com |year=2015 |accessdate=May 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political views===
Like his parents, Ford is a lifelong [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=May 23, 2008 |url=http://www.newsmeat.com/ |title=2008 Presidential Donor Watch |publisher=Newsmeat |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205031655/http://newsmeat.com/ |archivedate=February 5, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 7, 1995, Ford testified before the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] in support of the [[Dalai Lama]] and an independent [[Tibet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dalailamafilm.com/celebrities-and-others-banned-from-entering-tibet-or-china-109 |author=Khashyar Darvich | title = Celebrities and others banned from entering Tibet or China |publisher=Dalailamafilm.com |date=January 1, 2009 |accessdate=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Caracalla, ''Harrison Ford'', Silverback Books, 2007 p.93&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, he narrated the documentary ''[[Dalai Lama Renaissance]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dalailamafilm.com/ "Official Site of Dalai Lama Renaissance"], ''dalailamafilm.com'', Retrieved November 30, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, he publicly condemned the [[Iraq War]] and called for "regime change" in the United States. He also criticized Hollywood for making movies which were "more akin to video games than stories about human life and relationships", and he called for more [[gun control]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=May 23, 2008|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/08/27/1061663852052.html|title=Harrison Ford blasts US Iraq policy|work=The Age |date=August 27, 2003 | location=Melbourne, Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]] said his favorite role of Ford's was ''Air Force One'' because he "stood up for America", Ford reasoned that it was just a film and was doubtful that [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Trump's presidential bid]] would be successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/11/entertainment/harrison-ford-donald-trump-air-force-one-feat/|title=Harrison Ford has a fan in Trump|date=December 11, 2015|first=Melonyce|last=McAfee|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.today.com/popculture/harrison-ford-reminds-donald-trump-air-force-one-was-only-t61036|title=Harrison Ford reminds Donald Trump that 'Air Force One' was only a movie|first=Randee|last=Dawn|date=December 11, 2015|publisher=today.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaeology===
Following on his success portraying the archaeologist [[Indiana Jones]], Ford also plays a part in supporting the work of professional [[archaeologists]]. He serves as a General Trustee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=September 7, 2010|url=http://www.archaeological.org/about/governance|title=About the AIA|publisher=[[Archaeological Institute of America]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the Governing Board of the [[Archaeological Institute of America]] (AIA), North America's oldest and largest organization devoted to the world of archaeology. Ford assists them in their mission of increasing public awareness of archaeology and preventing looting and the illegal antiquities trade.

===Star Wars: Force for Change===

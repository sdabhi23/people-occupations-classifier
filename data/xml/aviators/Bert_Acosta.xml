'''Bertrand Blanchard Acosta''' (January 1, 1895 &amp;ndash; September 1, 1954) was a record-setting aviator. With [[Clarence D. Chamberlin]] they set an endurance record of 51 hours, 11 minutes, and 25 seconds in the air. He later flew in the [[Spanish Civil War]] in the [[Yankee Squadron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=4 Americans in Spain to Fly for Madrid.

He received numerous fines and suspensions for flying stunts such as flying under bridges or flying too close to buildings.&lt;ref name=died/&gt;

==Birth==
Acosta was born in [[San Diego, California]] to Miguel Acosta and Martha Blanche Reilly.&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Blanchard Acosta's mother had a half-brother with the surname of Snook.&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[Throop Polytechnic Institute]] in [[Pasadena, California]] from 1912 to 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earlyaviators.com/eacosta.htm |title=Bertrand Blanchard Acosta |accessdate=2007-09-25 |quote=Taught self to fly, August 1910; built experimental planes and continued personal research until 1912; joined Glenn H.

He taught himself to fly in August 1910 and built experimental airplanes up until 1912 when he began work for [[Glenn Curtiss]] as an apprentice on a [[seaplane|hydroplane]] project. In 1915 he worked as a flying instructor. He went to Canada and worked as an instructor for the [[Royal Flying Corps]] and [[Royal Naval Air Service]] in [[Toronto]]. In 1917 he was appointed chief instructor, [[Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps]] at Hazelhurst Field, [[Long Island]] where he test flew early open-cockpit aircraft such as the [[Continental KB-1]] over New York in below freezing conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|magazine=Aviation|title=Continental Pusher Biplane|page=35|date=1 February 1918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acosta married Mary Louise Brumley (1886–1962) in 1918 but they divorced in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Louise Brumley (1886&amp;ndash;1962) born on July 27, 1886 in Norfolk Virginia, and she was a descendant of Henry Clay. She died in 1962. Ida Clay Baker was her mother. She married John Earl Pringell after the divorce from Bert.&lt;/ref&gt; He won The Pulitzer Trophy Race in 1921 and the same year set an [[airspeed record]] of 176.9 miles an hour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/apjinternational/apj-s/2trimes99/ashcroft.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922 he served as a test pilot for the [[Stout Batwing Limousine]], Stout's forerunner to the [[Ford Trimotor]]. In 1925 he was a lieutenant in the [[U.S. Navy]] and was living at 1 Winslow Court in [[Naugatuck, Connecticut]]. He married Helen Belmont Pearsoll, on August 3, 1921.  They eventually separated but never divorced.

==Endurance record==
In April 1927, he and [[Clarence D. Chamberlin]] set an endurance record of 51 hours, 11 minutes, and 25 seconds in the air. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine reported on April 25, 1927:&lt;!--No renewal so the text is in the public domain--&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Engineer [[Giuseppe M. Bellanca]] of the [[Columbia Aircraft Corporation]] had conditioned an [[Wright-Bellanca WB-2 Columbia|elderly yellow-winged monoplane]] with one Wright motor, and scouted around for pilots. Lieut. [[Leigh Wade]], round-the-world flyer, declined the invitation, saying Mr. Bellanca's plans were too stunt-like, not scientific. Shrugging, Mr. Bellanca engaged Pilots [[Clarence Duncan Chamberlin]] and burly Bert Acosta, onetime auto speedster, to test his ship's endurance. Up they put from [[Mitchel Field, Long Island]], with 385 gallons of ethylated (high power) gasoline. All day they droned back and forth over suburbia, circled the [[Woolworth Building]], hovered over [[Hadley Field, New Jersey]], swung back to drop notes on [[Mitchel Field]]. All that starry night they wandered slowly around the sky, and all the next day, and through the next night, a muggy, cloudy one. Newsgatherers flew up alongside to shout unintelligible things through megaphones. Messrs. Acosta and Chamberlain were looking tired and oil-blobbed. They swallowed soup and sandwiches, caught catnaps on the mattressed fuel tank, while on and on they droned, almost lazily (about 80 m.p.h.) for they were cruising against time. Not for 51 hours, 11 minutes, 25 seconds, did they coast to earth, having broken the U.S. and world's records for protracted flight. In the same time, conditions favoring, they could have flown from [[Manhattan]] to [[Vienna]]. They had covered 4,100 miles. To Paris it is 3,600 miles from Manhattan. Jubilant, Engineer Bellanca's employers offered competitors a three-hour headstart in the race to Paris. The [[Bellanca]] monoplane's normal cruising speed is 110 m.p.h. She would require only some 35 hours to reach Paris—if she could stay up that long again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Paris Preliminaries |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,730448,00.html |quote=Engineer [[Giuseppe M. Bellanca]] of the [[Columbia Aircraft Corporation]] had conditioned an elderly yellow-winged monoplane with one Wright motor, and scouted around for pilots. Lieut. [[Leigh Wade]], round-the-world flyer, declined the invitation, saying Mr. Bellanca's plans were too stunt-like, not scientific. |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=April 25, 1927 |accessdate=2007-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Orteig Prize Attempt==
[[Columbia Aircraft Corp]] president [[Charles Levine]] planned on using [[Clarence Chamberlin]] or Bert Acosta as pilot with [[Lloyd W. Bertaud]] as copilot on their attempt at the [[Orteig prize]] in the [[Wright-Bellanca WB-2 Columbia]]. Levine bumped Bertaud from the copilot position, prompting an injunction preventing any Orteig record flight. [[Charles Lindbergh]] arrived on May 5, 1927. While Chamberlin waited for the injunction to be lifted, his other competition, [[Richard Evelyn Byrd|Admiral Byrd's]] team was repairing his Fokker C-2 Trimotor, the "[[America (C-2)|America]]" after a practice run crash. On May 20–21, 1927, Lindbergh left [[Roosevelt Field, New York|Roosevelt Field]] and crossing the Atlantic, while leaving the 'Columbia' and 'Atlantic' behind at the adjacent [[Curtiss Field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bellanca Aircraft |url=http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/GENERAL_AVIATION/bellanca/GA1.htm |accessdate=17 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121085815/http://centennialofflight.gov/essay/GENERAL_AVIATION/bellanca/GA1.htm |archivedate=21 November 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transatlantic flight==
On June 29, 1927, thirty-three days after Charles Lindbergh's record setting [[transatlantic flight]], Acosta flew from [[Roosevelt Field, New York|Roosevelt Field]] on Long Island to France with Commander [[Richard E. Byrd]], Lieutenant [[George O. Noville]] and [[Bernt Balchen]] aboard the ''[[America (C-2)|America]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/America-NX206.htm |title=
The Trans-Atlantic Flight of the 'America' |accessdate=2008-11-11 |quote= |publisher=Check-Six }}&lt;/ref&gt; A short film of Acosta, Byrd, George Noville, and [[Grover Whalen]] giving a farewell speech was filmed in the [[Phonofilm]] sound-on-film process on June 29 and released as ''America's Flyers''. During the flight, the (perhaps apocryphal) story was that Byrd had to hit Acosta over the head with a fire extinguisher or a flashlight when he got out of control from drinking during their flight.&lt;ref name=natural&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Pilot's Pilot |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,883487,00.html |quote=Long before anyone ever heard of Lindbergh, Chamberlin, Post or Earhart, one of aviation's big names was Bert Acosta. Famed as a 'natural' among pilots, he probably had a greater talent for flying than any man before or since. But like many another early barnstormer and stunter, he took to the fleshpots on earth as an offset to his work in the air. His life, consequently, became a rowdy romance in which brawls, jails and domestic entanglements were due to play a large part. |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date= June 10, 1935 |accessdate=2007-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bad Boy==
In 1928 [[Connecticut]] suspended his pilot license for trying to fly under the Whittemore Memorial Bridge in [[Naugatuck]]. According to local Naugatuck tradition, the wing span of his aircraft was much longer than the width of the center arch of the bridge. The flight may have been a publicity stunt, as there was an advertisement for Splitdorf Spark Plugs on the fuselage.

In 1929 he was fined $500 for low flying and stunting. When he failed to pay the fine, the [[Department of Commerce]] revoked his pilot license. He was arrested by Connecticut State troopers in 1930 for flying without a license.&lt;ref name=natural/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Bert Acosta Freed In Connecticut Case.

A new [[Terle Sportplane]] was being tested at [[Roosevelt Field]] in New York in 1931, but the [[Civil Aeronautics Administration (United States)|CAA]] did not register it as a licensed aircraft. The aircraft was later test flown by Acosta, who found it perfect for his use since he was currently grounded from flying licensed aircraft from a previous infraction. After performing aerobatics with the aircraft to a large crowd, Acosta and Terle planned to produce the aircraft together as the "Acosterle Wild Cet". The aircraft was test flown for two years, but could not meet certification requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=none|magazine=Experimenter|date=May 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931 with Captain Lisandro Garay of the Honduran Air Force he planned to fly from New York to [[Honduras]] . They left from [[Floyd Bennett Field]] and loaded their [[Bellanca monoplane]] with 360 gallons of gasoline to make a test flight, Bert disappeared and never made the flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Biggests |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,742123,00.html |quote=Captain Lisandro Garay of the Honduran Air Force last week at Floyd Bennett Field loaded a Bellanca monoplane with 360 gallons [of] gasoline and Bert Acosta 'to make a test flight' from New York to Honduras. Acosta sneaked away; Captain Garay took off, headed for [[Tegucigalpa]], reprimand, glory, or death. |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=August 17, 1931 |accessdate=2007-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spanish Civil War==
In 1936 Acosta was head of the [[Yankee Squadron]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]] with [[Eddie August Schneider]] and [[Frederic Ives Lord]].&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Blanchard Acosta had been living at 46 West 17th Street in New York City before leaving for Spain.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=3 U.S. Airmen Here to Explain Aid to Loyalists; Acosta, Berry, Schneider Fly to Capital With Their Attorney|quote= |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=January 20, 1937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Time'' magazine wrote on December 21, 1936:

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Death==
In December 1951 Acosta collapsed in a New York City bar and was hospitalized with [[tuberculosis]]. He died at the Jewish Consumptive's Relief Society sanatorium in [[Colorado]] in 1954.&lt;ref name=died&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Died. |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,820213,00.html |quote= Bert Acosta, 59, pilot of the historic multi-engined flight across the Atlantic (1927) with Admiral Richard E.

==Legacy==
In 2014, Acosta was posthumously inducted into the [[National Aviation Hall of Fame]], along with pilot and astronaut [[James McDivitt]], the first female airline captain [[Emily Warner]], [[Cirrus Aircraft|Cirrus]] founders and designers [[Dale and Alan Klapmeier]], and [[homebuilt aircraft]] racer [[Steve Wittman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aviation Hall Of Fame Honors Six|url=http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/Aviation-Hall-Of-Fame-Honors-Six221134-1.html|accessdate=23 December 2013}} His name was submitted for induction by Norberto Franco Cisneros.&lt;/ref&gt;

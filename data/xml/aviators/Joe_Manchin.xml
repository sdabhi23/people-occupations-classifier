'''Joseph Manchin III''' (born August 24, 1947) is an American politician serving as the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|senior]] [[United States Senator]] from [[West Virginia]], a seat he has held since 2010. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he previously served as the 34th [[Governor of West Virginia]] from 2005 to 2010 and the 27th [[Secretary of State of West Virginia]] from 2001 to 2005.

Manchin has been known throughout his career to be a conservative Democrat, a fact which has allowed him to hold office in West Virginia even as the state shifted from one of the most heavily Democratic in the country to one of the most heavily Republican.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/10/24/451336317/west-virginia-tells-the-story-of-americas-shifting-political-climate|title=West Virginia Tells The Story Of America's Shifting Political Climate|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won by a large margin the [[West Virginia gubernatorial election, 2004|2004 West Virginia gubernatorial election]] and reelected with an even larger margin in [[West Virginia gubernatorial election, 2008|2008]], even though in both years Republican presidential candidates captured the majority of West Virginia's votes. He won the [[United States Senate special election in West Virginia, 2010|special election in November 2010]] to fill the seat of Senator [[Robert Byrd]], the longest serving U.S. Senator in history, who died in office. Manchin was [[United States Senate election in West Virginia, 2012|elected to a full term]] in office with 60 percent of the vote in November 2012. Manchin became the state's senior U.S. Senator when [[Jay Rockefeller]] retired in 2015.

As a member of Congress, Manchin is known for his [[bipartisanship]], voting or working with [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] on issues such as abortion and gun ownership. He opposed the energy policies of President [[Barack Obama]], declined to vote on both the [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010]] and the [[DREAM ACT]], voted for removing federal funding from [[Planned Parenthood]] in 2015 (but voted to preserve funding for the organization in 2017), and voted to confirm most of President [[Donald Trump]]'s cabinet appointees.  In 2017, he voted against allowing states to divert money away from abortion providers. Manchin has repeatedly voted against attempts to repeal the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], also known as Obamacare. He voted against the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017|2017 Republican tax plan]]. Manchin has complained about the "toxic" lack of bipartisanship in Congress on almost every issue. "Liberal activists argue he is too conservative for the Democratic Party, while Republicans argue he is too liberal for West Virginia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Foran|first1=Clare|title=West Virginia's Conservative Democrat Gets a Primary Challenger|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/joe-manchin-bernie-sanders-primary-challenge-west-virginia-senate-2018/525918/|website=The Atlantic|accessdate=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Manchin was born in 1947 in [[Farmington, West Virginia]], a small coal mining town, the second of five children of Mary O. (née Gouzd) and John Manchin.&lt;ref name=USNews&gt;{{cite web |title=10 Things You Didn't Know About West Virginia Gov.

His father was of [[Italy|Italian]] descent and his maternal grandparents were [[Czechoslovak]] [[immigration|immigrants]].&lt;ref name=USNews/&gt;&lt;ref name=vt-z&gt;{{Cite news|last=Baxter|first=Anna|title=Day 2: Democratic National Convention|pages=|publisher=WSAZ-TV|date=August 26, 2008|url=http://www.wsaz.com/political/headlines/27439319.html|accessdate=November 3, 2010}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His father owned a carpet and furniture store, and his grandfather, Joseph Manchin, owned a grocery store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wvobserver.com/2010/07/a-day-with-joe-manchin/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100807232205/http://www.wvobserver.com/2010/07/a-day-with-joe-manchin/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=August 7, 2010|title=The Observer » Blog Archive » A Day with Joe Manchin|date=August 7, 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father and his grandfather both served as Mayor of [[Farmington, West Virginia]]. His uncle, [[A. James Manchin|A.J. Manchin]], was a member of the [[West Virginia House of Delegates]] and was elected as the state's [[West Virginia Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] and [[Treasurer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nationaljournal.com/pubs/almanac/2006/people/wv/wvgv.htm]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105013606/http://nationaljournal.com/pubs/almanac/2006/people/wv/wvgv.htm|date=January 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manchin graduated from [[North Marion High School (West Virginia)|Farmington High School]] in 1965.&lt;ref name=OurStates&gt;{{cite news |title=Joe Manchin III |author=Fournier, Eddie |work=Our States: West Virginia [serial online] |date=November 2008 |pages=1–3 |publisher=[[EBSCO Publishing]] |isbn=1-4298-1207-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He entered [[West Virginia University]] on a [[American football|football]] [[athletic scholarship|scholarship]] in 1965; however, an injury during practice ended his football career. He graduated in 1970 with a degree in [[Bachelor of Business Administration#Information management|business administration]] and later became involved in several family-owned businesses.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==Early political career==
Manchin was elected to the [[West Virginia House of Delegates]] in 1982 at the age of 35 and was elected to the [[West Virginia Senate]] in 1986, where he served until 1996. He ran for Governor in 1996, finishing second to [[Charlotte Pritt]] among a large group of candidates in the Democratic [[primary election]]. He later ran and was elected as [[Secretary of State of West Virginia]] in 2000.

==Governor of West Virginia==
Manchin announced his intention to challenge incumbent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Governor, [[Bob Wise]], in the 2004 Democratic [[primary election]] in May 2003. Wise decided not to seek re-election after a scandal, and Manchin won the Democratic primary and [[West Virginia gubernatorial election, 2004|general election]] by large margins. His election marked the first time that two people of the same political party had followed one another in the West Virginia Governor's office since 1964.

Manchin was a member of the [[National Governors Association]], the [[Southern Governors' Association]], and the [[Democratic Governors Association]]. He was also chairman of the Southern States Energy Board, state's chair of the [[Appalachian Regional Commission]] and chairman of the Interstate Mining Compact Commission.

In July 2005, [[Massey Energy]] [[chief executive officer|CEO]] [[Don Blankenship]] sued Manchin, alleging that Manchin had violated Blankenship's [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights by threatening increased government scrutiny of his coal operations in retaliation for Blankenship's political activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Massey CEO sues W.Va. governor in federal court|url=http://www.ohvec.org/links/news/archive/2005/fair_use/07_27.html|publisher=The Herald-Dispatch|accessdate=May 26, 2012|author=JENNIFER BUNDY|date=July 27, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blankenship had donated substantial funds into campaigns to defeat a proposed pension bond amendment and oppose the re-election of [[Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia|state Supreme Court]] Justice [[Warren McGraw]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=West Virginia: The story behind the score|url=http://www.stateintegrity.org/westvirginia_story_subpage|publisher=stateintegrity.org|accessdate=May 26, 2012|author=Eric Newhouse|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522133040/http://www.stateintegrity.org/westvirginia_story_subpage|archivedate=May 22, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he fought against a proposed increase in the [[severance tax]] on extraction of mineral resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The WV Coal Equation: Living With Past Peak Production|url=http://calhounpowerline.com/2010/04/17/wv-coal-living-with-past-peak-production/|publisher=calhounpowerline.com|accessdate=May 26, 2012|date=April 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after defeat of the pension bond amendment, the state Division of Environmental Protection (DEP) revoked a permit approval for controversial new [[silo]]s near Marsh Fork Elementary School in [[Raleigh County, West Virginia|Raleigh County]]. While area residents had complained for some time that the coal operation there endangered their children, Blankenship claimed that the DEP acted in response to his opposition to the bond amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rape of Appalachia|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2006/05/appalachia200605|publisher=Vanity Fair|accessdate=May 26, 2012|author=Michael Shnayerson|date=May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2006 Sago Mine disaster]] in early January 2006 in [[Upshur County, West Virginia]], Manchin appeared to confirm incorrect reports that 12 miners had survived;{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} in actuality only one survived. Manchin later acknowledged that an unintentional miscommunication had occurred with rescue teams in the mine.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} On February 1, 2006, he ordered a stop to all coal production in West Virginia, pending safety checks, after two more miners were killed in separate accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KgIyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OaoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1129,4463371&amp;dq=governor+asks+coal+mines+to+stop+production&amp;hl=en|title=W.Va. governor asks for halt in coal production|author=Lawrence Messina|agency=Associated Press|work=The Beauford Gazette|date=February 2, 2006|accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteen West Virginia coal miners died from mining accidents in early 2006. In November 2006, [[SurveyUSA]] ranked him as one of the most popular governors in the country with a 74 percent approval rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Approval Ratings For All 50 Governors|date=November 20, 2006|publisher=SurveyUSA|url=http://www.surveyusa.com/50State2006/State50StateGovernor061120.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manchin easily won re-election to a second term as governor in [[West Virginia gubernatorial election, 2008|2008]] against Republican [[Russ Weeks]], capturing 69.77% percent of the vote and winning every county.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gov.

Due to the declining health of Senator [[Robert Byrd]], speculation focused on what Manchin's response would be if Byrd died. The governor consistently refused to comment on the subject prior to Byrd's death, except for stating that he would not appoint himself to the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|3Hw56gkJIPE|Joe Manchin stated that he would not select himself for the US senate position should Robert Byrd be unable to serve a full term}}{{dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Byrd died on June 28, 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Lisa Lerer |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-06-28/robert-byrd-longest-serving-u-s-senator-dies-at-92.html |title=Robert Byrd, Longest-Serving U.S. Senator, Dies at 92 |publisher=Bloomberg Business Week |date=June 28, 2010 |accessdate=December 29, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702010614/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-06-28/robert-byrd-longest-serving-u-s-senator-dies-at-92.html |archivedate=July 2, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Manchin appointed [[Carte Goodwin]], his 36-year-old legal adviser, on July 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/07/16/pol.byrd.vacant.seat/index.html?eref=rss_politics&amp;iref=polticker |work=CNN |title=West Virginia governor to name Byrd replacement|author=CNN Wire Staff | date= July 16, 2010|accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2012====
{{main|United States Senate election in West Virginia, 2012}}
Manchin chose to stand for reelection to a full term in 2012. According to the Democratic firm [[Public Policy Polling]], early polling found Manchin heavily favored, leading Congresswoman [[Shelley Moore Capito]] 50–39, 2010 opponent [[John Raese]] 60–31, and Congressman [[David McKinley]] 57–28.&lt;ref name="PPP"&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchin leads Capito, Raese, McKinley for 2012 re-election|url= http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/PPP_Release_WV_0125424.pdf |publisher=[[Public Policy Polling]] |date=January 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manchin had not endorsed his party's candidate, President Barack Obama, for the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 presidential election]], saying that he had "some real differences" with the presumptive nominees of both major parties, finding fault with Obama's [[Economic policy of Barack Obama|economic]] and [[energy policy of the Obama administration|energy policies]], and questioning [[Political positions of Mitt Romney|Romney's understanding]] of the "challenges facing ordinary people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dem Senator Doesn't Know If He Will Vote For Obama |date=April 20, 2012 |url= http://washington.cbslocal.com/2012/04/20/dem-senator-doesnt-know-if-he-will-vote-for-obama/ |publisher= [[CBS Radio|CBS Local Media]]| work=[[WDCH-FM|WNEW-FM]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manchin defeated Republican John Raese and Mountain Party candidate [[Bob Henry Baber]] with 60.49% of the total vote and won a full term in the U.S. Senate.&lt;ref name="apps.sos.wv.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.sos.wv.gov/elections/results/results.aspx?year=2012&amp;eid=13&amp;county=Statewide|title=Statewide Results : General Election - November 6, 2012|publisher=Apps.sos.wv.gov|accessdate=January 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the Republican side, Manchin is being challenged by West Virginia Attorney General [[Patrick Morrisey]]. In August 2017, Morrisey publicly asked Manchin to resign from the Senate Democratic leadership team. Manchin responded, "I don't give a shit, you understand?" to a ''Charleston Gazette-Mail'' reporter when asked about Morrisey's call. "I just don't give a shit. Don't care if I get elected, don't care if I get defeated, how about that?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wvrecord.com/stories/511174813-manchin-says-he-doesn-t-give-a-sh-t-about-morrisey-s-demand|title=Manchin says he 'doesn't give a sh-t' about Morrisey's demand|last=Dickerson|first=Chris|date=August 7, 2017|work=West Virginia Record|access-date=December 1, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tenure===
Manchin was sworn in by Vice President [[Joe Biden]] on November 15, 2010, succeeding interim Senator [[Carte Goodwin]]. Manchin named Democratic strategist Chris Kofinis to be his chief of staff. Before his swearing-in, rumors suggested that the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] was courting Manchin to change parties.&lt;ref name="Stirewalt Switch"&gt;{{cite news| last=Stirewalt|first=Chris|title=Today's Power Play: GOP Sweetens its Offer to Manchin| url= http://politics.blogs.foxnews.com/2010/11/08/todays-power-play-gop-sweetens-its-offer-manchin| accessdate= December 10, 2010|newspaper=FOX News|date=November 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Republicans later suggested that Manchin was the source of the rumors,&lt;ref name="Drucker"&gt;{{cite news| last=Drucker| first= David| title=GOP Suggests Manchin Source of Own Party-Switch Rumors| url= http://www.rollcall.com/news/-200418-1.html| accessdate=December 10, 2010|newspaper=Roll Call| date=November 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; they attempted to convince him again in 2014 after retaking control of the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/223077-mcconnell-expected-to-woo-king-manchin|title=McConnell expected to woo King, Manchin|author=Alexander Bolton|work=The Hill|accessdate=January 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He again rejected their overtures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/11/05/joe-manchin-on-election-results-this-is-a-real-a-whooping/|title=Joe Manchin on election results: 'This is a real ass-whuppin'|work=Washington Post|accessdate=January 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Election Day 2016, however, Manchin said he might switch parties if necessary to give the GOP a majority in the Senate. He later stated, however, that he would stay in the Democratic Party throughout his time in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kleefeld|first1=Eric|title=Democratic Sen.

In 2015, Manchin announced that he would seek re-election to the Senate in [[United States Senate elections, 2018|2018]].&lt;ref name=manchinrunning2018&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cheney|first1=Kyle|title=Joe Manchin won't run for West Virginia governor|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/joe-manchin-wont-run-for-wva-governor-117119.html?hp=c2_3|accessdate=April 20, 2015|publisher=Politico|date=April 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political positions ===
Joe Manchin is often considered to be a [[Centrism|moderate]] or even [[conservative Democrat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-manchin/democratic-senator-criticizes-pelosis-immigration-rhetoric-idUSKBN1FH0RC|title=Democratic senator criticizes Pelosi's immigration comment|date=January 28, 2018|work=Reuters|accessdate=March 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/joe-manchin-bernie-sanders-primary-challenge-west-virginia-senate-2018/525918/|title=Will Liberals Force a Conservative Democrat Out of the Senate?|last=Foran|first=Clare|work=The Atlantic|access-date=March 18, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[FiveThirtyEight|Five ThirtyEight]]'', which tracks Congressional votes, has found that Manchin voted with Trump's position nearly 61% of the time as of June 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-trump-score/joe-manchin-iii/|title=Tracking Joe Manchin III In The Age Of Trump |last=Bycoffe|first=Aaron|date=January 30, 2017|work=FiveThirtyEight|access-date=March 18, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Congressional Quarterly]]'' published a study finding that Manchin voted with Trump's position 71% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.journalgazette.net/blog/political-notebook/20180214/study-finds-62-of-donnellys-votes-support-trumps-positions |title=Study finds 62% of Donnelly's votes support Trump's positions {{!}} Political notebook {{!}} Journal Gazette |website=www.journalgazette.net|access-date=June 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[GovTrack]], Joe Manchin is the most conservative Democrat as of 2017 and GovTrack's analysis places Manchin to right of all other Democrats and to the right of Republican Senators [[Susan Collins]] and [[Lisa Murkowski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/joe_manchin/412391|title=Joe Manchin III, Senator for West Virginia - GovTrack.us|website=GovTrack.us|language=en|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fiscally conservative [[Americans for Prosperity]] gives him a lifetime 32% score and [[John Birch Society|The John Birch Society]], another conservative organization, rated him as agreeing with their position 43% of the time in 2016; conversely, the progressive [[Americans for Democratic Action]] scored Manchin as having a liberal quotient of 35% in 2016 and 60% liberal in 2015.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://votesmart.org/candidate/evaluations/7547/joe-manchin-iii#.WzMzw1MvyT8|title=Joe Manchin III's Ratings and Endorsements |website=votesmart.org|accessdate=July 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[National Journal|The National Journal]]'', in 2013, gave Manchin an overall score of 55% conservative and 46% liberal.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

====Coal industry====
On October 6, 2010, Manchin directed a lawsuit aimed at overturning new federal rules concerning [[mountaintop removal mining]]. Filed by the state Department of Environmental Protection, the lawsuit "accuses U.S. EPA of overstepping its authority and asks the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia to throw out the federal agency's new guidelines for issuing [[Clean Water Act]] permits for coal mines." In order to qualify for the permits, mining companies need to prove their projects would not cause the concentration of pollutants in the local water to rise 5 times past the normal level. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that EPA Administrator [[Lisa P. Jackson|Lisa Jackson]] said the new legislation would protect 95 percent of aquatic life by banning operators from dumping mine waste into [[stream]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=W.Va. Sues Obama, EPA Over Mining Coal Regulations |url=https://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2010/10/06/06greenwire-wva-sues-obama-epa-over-mining-coal-regulation-48964.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=April 26, 2012|author=Patrick Reis|date=October 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manchin has received criticism from environmentalists due to his close family ties to the coal industry. He served as president of Energysystems in the late 1990s before becoming active in politics. On his financial disclosures in 2009 and 2010, his reported earnings from the company were $1,363,916 and $417,255 respectively.&lt;ref name="The New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sen.

====Taxes====
According to ''[[Politico]]'', Manchin sees Trump's [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]] as "a closed process" that "makes little impact in the paychecks of the people in his state." At the same time, he posited the bill contains "some good things...Initially people will benefit", although ultimately voting against it. In turn, NRSC spokesman Bob Salera stated that he had "turned his back and voted with Washington Democrats."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dovere|first1=EDWARD-ISAAC|title='I Was An Easy Pickup': How Trump Lost Manchin on Taxes |url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/12/19/joe-manchin-interview-trump-franken-podcast-216118 |website=Politico |accessdate=March 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drucker|first1=David M.|title=Joe Manchin struggles to explain opposition to GOP tax bill|url=https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/joe-manchin-struggles-to-explain-opposition-to-gop-tax-bill|website=Washington Examiner|accessdate=March 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Terrorism====
In June 2017, he was one of five Democrats who, by voting against a Senate resolution disapproving of arms sales to [[Saudi Arabia]], ensured its failure. Potential primary opponent [[Paula Jean Swearengin]] charged that because Manchin's vote, weapons sold to the Saudis "could possibly end up in the hands of terrorists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jilani|first1=Zaid|title=Joe Manchin was one of five democrats who save Saudi arms sales.

====Abortion====
Manchin identifies as [[pro-life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2014/04/22/pro-life_democrats_squeezed_by_a_partisan_issue_122354.html |title=Pro-Life Democrats, Squeezed by a Partisan Issue |last1=Gonzalez |first1=Jose, R. |date=April 22, 2014 |publisher=''Real Clear Politics'' |access-date=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has mixed ratings from both [[Abortion-rights movements|pro-choice]] and [[Anti-abortion movements|pro-life]] political action groups. In 2018, [[Planned Parenthood]], which supports legal abortion, gave Manchin a lifetime grade of 57% while [[National Right to Life Committee|National Right to Life]] (NRLC), which opposes abortion, gave Manchin a 40% score; in 2016, the NRLC scored Manchin at 75% and [[NARAL Pro-Choice America]] gave him a 100% in the same year.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; On August 3, 2015, he broke with Democratic leadership by voting in favor of a Republican-sponsored bill to terminate federal funding for [[Planned Parenthood]], a nonprofit organization that provides reproductive health services, including abortions, both in the United States and globally. The organization had been [[Planned Parenthood 2015 undercover videos controversy|accused]] of "illegal activity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/08/03/joe-manchin-will-vote-to-defund-planned-parenthood/ |title=Joe Manchin and Joe Donnelly vote to defund Planned Parenthood |last1=Snell |first1=Kelsey |date=August 3, 2015 |publisher=''The Washington Post'' |access-date=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has the endorsement of [[Democrats for Life of America]], a pro-life Democratic PAC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kunc.org/post/5-senators-who-will-likely-decide-next-supreme-court-justice|title=5 Senators Who Will Likely Decide The Next Supreme Court Justice|last=Davis|first=Susan|access-date=July 3, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 30, 2017, however, Manchin expressed support for abortion rights providers by voting against H.J.Res. 43.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/13/donald-trump-gives-states-power-cut-planned-parent|title=Trump Gives States Power to Cut off Planned Parenthood Money|last1=Dinan|first1=Stephen|date=April 13, 2017|website=www.washingtontimes.com|publisher=''[[The Washington Times]]''|accessdate=April 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A pending federal regulation would have prevented states from withholding money from abortion providers.

====Afghanistan====
On June 21, 2011, Manchin delivered a speech on the Senate floor calling for a "substantial and responsible reduction in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–2014)|United States' military presence in Afghanistan]]." He said, "We can no longer afford to rebuild Afghanistan and America. We must choose. And I choose America."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manchin: It's Time to Rebuild America, Not Afghanistan|url=http://www.whsv.com/home/headlines/Manchin_Its_Time_to_Rebuild_America_Not_Afghanistan_124300294.html|publisher=Whsv.com|accessdate=June 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manchin introduced legislation to reduce the use of overseas service and security contractors. He successfully amended the 2013 National Defense Authorization Act to cap contractors' taxpayer funded salaries at $230,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manchin questions military officials on contractors|url=http://www.wvgazette.com/News/politics/201203090208|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130209214610/http://www.wvgazette.com/News/politics/201203090208|dead-url=yes|archive-date=February 9, 2013|publisher=Charleston Gazette|accessdate=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bipartisanship====
In his first year in office, Manchin met one-on-one with all of his 99 Senate colleagues in an effort to get to know them better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manchin marks a year in Senate|url=http://www.theintermountain.com/page/content.detail/id/547744.html|publisher=The Inter-Mountain|accessdate=November 16, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126014848/http://www.theintermountain.com/page/content.detail/id/547744.html|archivedate=January 26, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 13, 2010, Manchin participated in the launch of No Labels, a new, nonpartisan organization that is "committed to bringing all sides together to move the nation forward."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sen.

[[Pat Toomey]] advocates reducing gun regulations, but in 2013, he worked with Joe Manchin to introduce legislation that would require a [[background check]] for most gun sales. The [[Manchin Amendment No. 715|Manchin-Toomey bill]] was voted on and defeated on April 17, 2013, by a vote of 54–46 because to pass it needed 60 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Senate rejects gun background checks|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/04/17/guns-background-checks-manchin-senate/2090105/|publisher=''USA Today''|accessdate=April 17, 2013|first1=Gregory|last1=Korte|first2=Catalina|last2=Camia|date=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Drugs====
In June 2011, Manchin joined Senator [[Chuck Schumer]] (D-NY) in seeking a crackdown on [[Bitcoin|Bitcoin currency transactions]], saying that they facilitated [[illegal drug trade]] transactions. "The transactions leave no traditional [bank transfer] [[money trail]] for investigators to follow, and leave it hard to prove a package recipient knew in advance what was in a shipment," using an "'[[anonymity|anonymizing]] network' known as [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/08/us-financial-bitcoins-idUSTRE7573T320110608|title=Senators seek crackdown on Bitcoin currency|work=Reuters|accessdate=January 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One opinion website said the Senators wanted "to disrupt [the] [[Silk Road (marketplace)|Silk Road drug website]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hammeroftruth.com/2011/senators-charles-schumer-joe-manchin-discuss-targetting-bitcoin-exchanges-in-convoluted-scheme-to-disrupt-silk-road-drug-website/ |title=Senators Charles Schumer, Joe Manchin discuss targetting bitcoin exchanges in convoluted scheme to disrupt Silk Road drug website |work=Hammer of Truth |accessdate=January 14, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513135325/http://hammeroftruth.com/2011/senators-charles-schumer-joe-manchin-discuss-targetting-bitcoin-exchanges-in-convoluted-scheme-to-disrupt-silk-road-drug-website/ |archivedate=May 13, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Energy====
Manchin sits on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and supports a comprehensive, all-of-the-above energy approach that uses coal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loganbanner.com/view/full_story/18105018/article-Manchin--‘Energy-belongs-to-all-of-us--regardless-of-party-labels'] {{dead link|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manchin's first bill in the Senate dealt with what he calls the EPA's overreach. After the EPA vetoed a previously-approved permit for the Spruce Mine in Logan County, West Virginia, Senator Manchin offered the "EPA Fair Play Act."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manchin touts EPA bill in maiden Senate speech|url=http://www.dailymail.com/ap/ApTopStories/201102031081|publisher=Charleston Daily Mail|accessdate=February 3, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130121100543/http://www.dailymail.com/ap/ApTopStories/201102031081|archivedate=January 21, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill would "clarify and confirm the authority of the Environment Protection Agency to deny or restrict the use of defined areas as disposal sites for the discharge of dredged or filled material."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=S. 272  (is) - EPA Fair Play Act|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112s272is/content-detail.html|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manchin said the bill would prevent the agency from "changing its rules on businesses after permits have already been granted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Senator Manchin Introduces EPA Fair Play Act Of 2011|url=http://www.wchstv.com/newsroom/eyewitness/110203_4192.shtml|publisher=WCHS|accessdate=February 3, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207001712/http://www.wchstv.com/newsroom/eyewitness/110203_4192.shtml|archivedate=February 7, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 14, 2011, Manchin chaired his first field hearing of that committee in Charleston, West Virginia, to focus on [[Marcellus Formation|Marcellus Shale]] natural gas development and production. Manchin said, "We are literally sitting on top of tremendous potential with the Marcellus shale. We need to work together to chart a path forward in a safe and responsible way that lets us produce energy right here in America."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Senator Manchin Leads Field Hearing On Marcellus Shale|url=http://www.wvmetronews.com/news.cfm?func=displayfullstory&amp;storyid=49211|publisher=Wvmetronews.com|date=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manchin supports building the [[Keystone XL Pipeline]] from Canada. Manchin has said, "It makes so much common sense that you want to buy [oil] off your friends and not your enemies." The pipeline would span over 2,000 miles across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manchin Speaks Out About 'Political Football' Pipeline Treatment|url=http://www.wvnstv.com/story/16646213/manchin-speaks-out-about-political-football-pipeline-treatment|publisher=Wvnstv.com|accessdate=January 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 9, 2011, Manchin introduced the "Fair Compliance Act" with Senator [[Dan Coats]] (R-IN). Their bill would "lengthen timelines and establish benchmarks for utilities to comply with two major Environmental Protection Agency air pollution rules. The legislation would extend the compliance deadline for the [[Cross-State Air Pollution Rule]], or CSAPR, by three years and the deadline for the Utility MACT rule by two years -- setting both to January 1, 2017."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manchin Co-Sponsors Bill to Delay EPA Air Pollution Rules|url=http://www.statejournal.com/story/16002212/manchin-co-sponsors-bill-to-delay-epa-air-pollution-rules|publisher=The State Journal|accessdate=November 9, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116045354/http://www.statejournal.com/story/16002212/manchin-co-sponsors-bill-to-delay-epa-air-pollution-rules|archivedate=November 16, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manchin introduced the "American Alternative Fuels Act" on May 10, 2011, with Senator [[John Barrasso]] (R-WY). The bill would remove restrictions on the development of alternative fuels, repeal part of the 2007 energy bill restricting the federal government from buying alternative fuels and encourage the development of algae-based fuels and synthetic natural gas. Regarding the bill, Manchin said, "Our unacceptably high gas prices are hurting not only West Virginians, but all Americans, and they underscore a critical need: the federal government needs to be a partner, not an obstacle, for businesses that can transform our domestic energy resources into gas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manchin introduces alternative fuels bill|url=http://www.newsandsentinel.com/page/content.detail/id/547780/Manchin-introduces-alternative-fuels-bill.html?nav=5061|publisher=Newsandsentinel.com|date=May 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Environment====
In 2011 Manchin was the only Democratic Senator to support the proposed [[Energy Tax Prevention Act]], which sought to prohibit the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] from regulating [[greenhouse gas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John M. |last=Broder |title=House Panel Votes to Limit E.P.A.

The [[League of Conservation Voters]] gave him a 47% rating for 2016 and a lifetime 44% rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scorecard.lcv.org/moc/joe-manchin-iii|title=Check out Senator Joe Manchin III's Environmental Voting Record|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manchin criticized Obama's environmental regulations as a "war on coal" and demanded what he described as a proper balance between the needs of the environment and the coal business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trump Seeks an Ally, or At Least an Ear, in West Virginia Democrat|url=http://fortune.com/2017/02/04/trump-joe-manchin-alliance/|website=Fortune|accessdate=March 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' has noted that while professing environmental concerns, he has consistently stood up for coal, saying "no one is going to stop using fossil [fuels] for a long time." He "does not deny the existence of man-made climate change," wrote the ''Los Angeles Times'', but "is reluctant to curtail it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Banerjee|first1=Neela|title=2 Senate Democrats explore how to protect coal jobs and the environment|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-congress-climate-exchange-20141021-story.html|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=March 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2017, he was one of only two Democratic senators to vote to confirm [[Scott Pruitt]] as [[Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/02/17/us/politics/live-congress-votes-scott-pruitt-epa.html|title=How Senators Voted on Scott Pruitt for E.P.A.

====Federal budget and federal banking regulation====
Manchin has co-sponsored [[balanced budget amendment]]s put forth by Senators [[Mike Lee (U.S. politician)|Mike Lee]] (R-UT),&lt;ref&gt;[http://wvgazette.com/News/201103021152?page=2]  {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120716013501/http://wvgazette.com/News/201103021152?page=2|date=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Shelby]] (R-AL), and [[Mark Udall]] (D-CO).&lt;ref&gt;[http://wvgazette.com/News/201104261087?page=2]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028170602/http://wvgazette.com/News/201104261087?page=2|date=October 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also voted against raising the federal debt ceiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wvgazette.com/News/201201270144|title=Rockefeller, Manchin cast opposite votes on debt ceiling|publisher=Wvgazette.com|accessdate=January 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, he was one of 17 Democrats to break with their party and vote with Republicans to ease banking regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/15/why-senate-democrats-voted-for-bank-bill-to-ease-dodd-frank-rules.html|title=Why 17 Democrats voted with Republicans to ease bank rules|last=Schoen|first=Jacob Pramuk, John W.|date=March 15, 2018|work=CNBC|access-date=June 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gun laws====
In 2012 Manchin's candidacy was endorsed by the [[National Rifle Association]] (NRA), which gave him an "A" rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NRA-PVF Endorses Joe Manchin for U.S. Senate in West Virginia|url=http://www.nrapvf.org/news-alerts/2012/10/nra-pvf-endorses-joe-manchin-for-us-senate-in-west-virginia.aspx|newspaper=NRA Polictical Victory Fund|date=October 2, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213173935/http://www.nrapvf.org/news-alerts/2012/10/nra-pvf-endorses-joe-manchin-for-us-senate-in-west-virginia.aspx|archivedate=December 13, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting|Sandy Hook shooting]], Manchin partnered with Republican Senator [[Pat Toomey]] to introduce a bill that would have strengthened background checks on gun sales. Though the legislation never acquired enough votes to win Senate passage, the NRA targeted him in an attack ad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Friedman|first=Dan|title=Sen.

Manchin was criticized in 2013 for agreeing to an interview with ''[[The Journal (West Virginia newspaper)|The Journal]]'' in [[Martinsburg, West Virginia]], but demanding that he not be asked any questions about gun control or the Second Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Simpson|first1=Connor|title=Sen.

In 2016, referring to the difficulty of keeping guns out of the hands of potential terrorists, Manchin said, "due process is what's killing us right now." This comment drew the criticism of both the [[National Rifle Association|NRA]] and the [[Cato Institute]], which accused Manchin of attacking a fundamental constitutional principle. "With all respect," commented Ilya Shapiro of Cato, "due process is the essential basis of America."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shapiro|first1=Ilya|title=Does Joe Manchin Want to Make America a Police State?|url=https://www.cato.org/blog/does-joe-manchin-want-make-america-police-state|website=Cato Institute|accessdate=March 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sen.

====Health care====
Manchin campaigned in 2010 as being ready to vote for repeal of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], also known as Obamacare, but the next year he voted for Obamacare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=Matt|title=Joe Manchin Still Doesn't Like Obamacare|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2012/06/28/joe_manchin_still_doesn_t_like_obamacare.html|website=Slate|accessdate=March 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schor|first1=Elana|title=Manchin: I'll help GOP 'repair' Obamacare|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/joe-manchin-obamacare-fixes-233541|website=Politico|accessdate=March 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 27, 2013, Manchin voted to restore funding for Obamacare as part of an amendment to legislation funding government operations for 45 days. The amendment also omitted House-passed language prioritizing debt payments should Congress fail to increase the nation's borrowing limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=113&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00208 | title=U.S. Senate: Legislation &amp; Records Home &gt; Votes &gt; S.Amdt.1974 | publisher=Senate.gov | date= |accessdate=September 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 14, 2017, Manchin expressed concern at the strict party-line vote on repealing Obamacare and said he could not, in good conscience, vote to repeal without a new plan in place. He added, however, that he was willing to work with Trump and the GOP to formulate a replacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Brien|first1=Soledad|title=SEN.

During 2016-17, Manchin read to the Senate several letters from constituents about loved ones' deaths from opioids and urged his colleagues to act to prevent more deaths. Manchin took "an unusual proposal" to President Trump to address the crisis and called for a "war on drugs" that involves not punishment but treatment. He proposed the LifeBOAT Act, which would fund treatment. He also opposes [[Legalization of marijuana|marijuana legalization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blau|first1=Max|title=Senator Joe Manchin: Time for a new 'war on drugs' to tackle opioids|url=https://www.statnews.com/2017/03/27/manchin-opioid-war-on-drugs/|website=STAT|accessdate=March 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=King|first1=Joselyn|title=Sen.

==== Immigration ====
Joe Manchin is opposed to the [[DREAM Act]] and supports building a [[Border barrier|wall]] along the US southern border.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2010/12/dream-act-dies-in-senate-046573|title=DREAM Act dies in Senate|work=POLITICO|access-date=2018-08-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/392350-manchin-touts-support-for-trump-border-wall-in-new-ad|title=Manchin touts support for Trump border wall in new ad|last=Wise|first=Justin|date=2018-06-14|work=TheHill|access-date=2018-08-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manchin voted against the McCain-Coons proposal to create a pathway to citizenship for some undocumented immigrants without funding for a border wall and he voted against a comprehensive immigration bill proposed by [[Susan Collins]] which gave a pathway to citizenship for [[DREAM Act|Dreamers]] as well as funding for border security; he voted 'yes' to withholding funding for '[[Sanctuary city|sanctuary cities]]' and he voted in support of President Trump's proposal to give a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, build a border wall, and reduce legal immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/16/heres-how-your-senators-voted-on-failed-immigration-proposals.html|title=Here's how your senators voted on failed immigration proposals|last=Schoen|first=John W.|date=2018-02-16|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manchin has mixed ratings from political action committees opposed to illegal immigration; [[NumbersUSA|Numbers USA]], which seeks to reduce illegal and legal immigration, gave Manchin a 55% rating and the [[Federation for American Immigration Reform]], which also seeks to reduce legal immigration, gave him a 25% rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://votesmart.org/candidate/evaluations/7547/joe-manchin-iii/40#.W2sbMNJKiUk|title=The Voter's Self Defense System|website=Vote Smart|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Senior citizens====
To help locate missing senior citizens, Manchin introduced the [[Silver Alert]] Act in July 2011 to create a nationwide network for locating missing adults and senior citizens modeled after the [[AMBER Alert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wvmetronews.com/news.cfm?func=displayfullstory&amp;storyid=44122|title=WV MetroNews|publisher=Wvmetronews.com|accessdate=January 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manchin also sponsored the National Yellow Dot Act to create a voluntary program that would alert emergency services personnel responding to car accidents of the availability of personal and medical information on the car's owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsandsentinel.com/page/content.detail/id/557859/Bill-unveiled-for-seniors-in-emergency-situations.html?nav=5061|title=Bill unveiled for seniors in emergency situations|publisher=Newsand sentinel.com|accessdate=January 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manchin said in 2014 that he "would change Social Security completely. I would do it on an inflationary basis, as far as paying into payroll taxes, and change that, to keep us stabilized as far as cash flow. I'd do COLAs—I'd talk about [[Cost of living|COLA]] for 250 percent of poverty guidelines." Asked whether this meant he would "cut benefits to old people," Manchin said that "a rich old person...won't get the COLAs." He asked: "Do you want [[United States Chained Consumer Price Index|chained CPI]]? I can live with either one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weigel|first1=David|title=Joe Manchin, Grover Norquist, and the Economic Consensus of #ThisTown|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2014/03/18/joe_manchin_grover_norquist_and_the_economic_consensus_of_thistown.html|website=Slate|accessdate=March 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====LGBT rights====
On December 9, 2010, Manchin was the sole Democrat to vote against cloture for the 2011 [[National Defense Authorization Act]], which contained a provision to repeal [[Don't ask, don't tell|Don't Ask, Don't Tell]]. In an interview with ''[[The Associated Press]]'', Manchin cited the advice of retired military chaplains as a basis for his decision to vote against repeal.&lt;ref name="Chaplains"&gt;{{cite news|title=Manchin: Chaplains May Leave Military If 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' is Repealed|date=December 3, 2010|publisher=WOWK-TV|url=http://www.wowktv.com/story.cfm?func=viewstory&amp;storyid=90524|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101211105707/http://wowktv.com/story.cfm?func=viewstory&amp;storyid=90524|archivedate=December 11, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also indicated he wanted more time to "hear the full range of viewpoints from the citizens of West Virginia."&lt;ref name="Knezevich DADT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Knezevich|first=Alison|title=Manchin lone Democrat to oppose 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' repeal|url=http://www.wvgazette.com/News/201012091323|accessdate=December 10, 2010|newspaper=[[Charleston Gazette]]|date=December 9, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212235141/http://www.wvgazette.com/News/201012091323|archivedate=December 12, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A day later, he was publicly criticized at a gay rights rally for his position on the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joe Manchin booed over 'Don't ask' vote|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1210/46244.html|publisher=Politico|author=Scott Wong|date=December 10, 2010|accessdate=January 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====China====
In July 2017, he urged Trump to block the sale of the [[Chicago Stock Exchange]] to Chinese investors, arguing that China's "rejection of fundamental free-market norms and property rights of private citizens makes me strongly doubt whether an Exchange operating under the direct control of a Chinese entity can be trusted to 'self-regulate' now and in the future." He also expressed concern "that the challenges plaguing the Chinese market – lack of transparency, currency manipulation, etc. – will bleed into the Chicago Stock Exchange and adversely impact financial markets across the country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Louis|first1=Brian|title=Two Chinese bidders for Chicago Exchange are said to drop out|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-chicago-stock-exchange-chinese-bidders-drop-out-20171016-story.html|website=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=March 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== President Trump ====
Manchin welcomed [[Donald Trump]]'s presidency, saying: "He'll correct the trading policies, the imbalance in our trade policies, which are horrible." He supported the idea of Trump "calling companies to keep them from moving factories overseas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=KRUSE|first1=MICHAEL|last2=EVERETT|first2=BURGESS|title=Manchin in the Middle|url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/03/joe-manchin-senator-profile-west-virginia-red-state-democrat-bipartisan-214865|website=Politico|accessdate=March 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manchin voted for most of the Trump nominees. He was the only Democrat to vote in confirmation of controversial [[Trump cabinet]] appointees [[Jeff Sessions]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://heavy.com/news/2017/02/joe-manchin-jeff-sessions-trump-republican-democrat-neil-gorsuch-daughter-confirmation-vote-yes-west-virginia-bio/|title=Source: Joe Manchin: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know|access-date=February 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Steven Mnuchin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/02/13/us/politics/steven-mnuchin-confirmation-vote.html|title=How Senators Voted on Steven Mnuchin for Treasury Secretary|last=|first=|date=February 13, 2017|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=February 14, 2017|work=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of two Democrats who voted to confirm [[Scott Pruitt]] as [[Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency|EPA Administrator]], and one of three who voted to confirm [[Rex Tillerson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/31/us/politics/trump-cabinet-confirmation-votes.html|title=Source: How Each Senator Voted on Trump's Cabinet and Administration Nominees|access-date=February 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the 2016 elections approached, many reports speculated that Manchin would lose his loyalty to his party and switch to the Republican party if the Senate were in a 50-50 tie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theweek.com/speedreads/660613/democratic-sen-joe-manchin-reportedly-hasnt-ruled-switching-parties-tied-senate|title=Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin reportedly hasn't ruled out switching parties in a tied Senate|date=November 8, 2016|access-date=November 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to him already being conservative-leaning, for which many Democrats have criticized him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/is-there-room-for-joe-manchin-among-democrats-in-2016/|title=Is there room for Joe Manchin among Democrats in 2016?|access-date=November 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he later stated that he would stay with the Democratic party for at least as long as he stays in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/joe-manchin-remains-democrat-senate-231014|title=Source: Manchin to remain a Democrat|newspaper=POLITICO|access-date=November 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manchin was the first Democrat to say he would vote for President Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court, [[Neil Gorsuch]]. Manchin said, "During his time on the bench, Judge Gorsuch has received praise from his colleagues who have been appointed by both Democrats and Republicans. He has been consistently rated as a well-qualified jurist, the highest rating a jurist can receive, and I have found him to be an honest and thoughtful man."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wvrecord.com/stories/511099958-law-courts-manchin-becomes-first-democrat-to-say-he-ll-vote-for-gorsuch|title=Manchin becomes first Democrat to say he'll vote for Gorsuch|last=Dickerson|first=Chris|date=March 30, 2017|work=West Virginia Record|access-date=December 1, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the first Democrat to announce that he would meet with Trump's second Supreme Court nominee, [[Brett Kavanaugh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/07/25/supreme-court-pick-shakes-up-west-virginia-senate-race.html|title=Supreme Court pick shakes up West Virginia Senate race|last=Doocy|first=Peter|date=2018-07-25|work=Fox News|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2018 campaign for Senate, Manchin announced that he supports Trump's proposal to construct a [[Border barrier|border wall]] along the southern border of the continental United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-14/red-state-democrat-touts-border-wall-vote-in-bid-for-trump-fans|title=Manchin Touts Border Wall Vote in Bid for Trump Fans|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=June 22, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that he regrets voting for Hillary Clinton and would be open to supporting Donald Trump for President in [[United States presidential election, 2020|2020]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/06/06/manchin-says-regrets-clinton-support-could-back-trump-in-2020.html|title=Manchin says he regrets Clinton support, could back Trump in 2020|last=Shaw|first=Adam|date=June 6, 2018|work=Fox News|access-date=June 22, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Manchin is a member of the [[National Rifle Association]] and a licensed pilot.&lt;ref name="USNews" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Governor Manchin Speaks Out on Pro-Life |url=http://www.wvnstv.com/story.cfm?func=viewstory&amp;storyid=6580 |date=November 11, 2005 |accessdate=May 11, 2009 |work=WVNSTV.com |publisher=West Virginia Media Holdings, LLC |author=Jones, Katherine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826025257/http://www.wvnstv.com/story.cfm?func=viewstory&amp;storyid=6580 |archivedate=August 26, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=W.Va.

Together they have three children: [[Heather Bresch|Heather]], Joseph IV, and Brooke.&lt;ref name="USNews" /&gt;

In 2006 and 2010 Manchin delivered commencement addresses at [[Wheeling Jesuit University]] and at [[Davis &amp; Elkins College]], receiving honorary degrees from both institutions.

In December 2012, Manchin voiced his displeasure with [[MTV]]'s new reality show [[Buckwild (TV series)|Buckwild]], set in his home state's capital Charleston, and asked the network's president to cancel the show, which, he argued, depicted West Virginia in a negative, unrealistic fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/2chambers/wp/2012/12/07/joe-manchin-objects-to-mtvs-buckwild-reality-show/|title = Joe Manchin objects to MTV's 'Buckwild' reality show|last = O'Keefe|first = Ed|date = December 7, 2012|work = Washington Post|access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The show ended after its first season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Amin|first=Salwa|title=Buckwild|date=January 3, 2013|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2555880/|last2=Boulet|last3=Bradley|last4=Davis|first2=Tyler|first3=Shae|first4=Anna|accessdate=January 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===Heather Bresch===
[[West Virginia University]] (WVU) awarded Manchin's daughter, [[Heather Bresch]], an [[MBA]] in 2007, the year she became [[Chief Operations Officer|COO]] at [[Mylan Inc.]], the third largest generic pharmaceutical manufacturer in the U.S. with headquarters in Morgantown, adjacent to the WVU campus. The ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' reported that in order to justify this degree, university officials had added courses to her transcript that she had never taken and altered grades she had received. The ensuing controversy resulted in the rescinding of her MBA and the resignation of the university president, Mike Garrison, a Manchin family friend, and Garrison's legal counsel and the Dean of the Business School. A panel was convened to fully investigate the measure.&lt;ref name="huntingtonnews.net"&gt;{{cite web|title=Joe Manchin III: The Harry Houdini of West Virginia Politics|url=http://www.huntingtonnews.net/8650|publisher=Huntington News|accessdate=April 26, 2012|author=|date=September 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the MBA controversy erupted, according to ''[[The Huntington News]]'', Manchin "act[ed] as though he and his wife, Gayle, were somehow the victims of this hoax that almost cost WVU its academic credibility." According to the Huntington News, "the Manchins were seen as people willing to destroy [the university's] reputation rather than admit a mistake."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/opinion/editorials/message-for-wvu-the-board-of-governors-must-restore-credibility-394283 | title=Message for WVU: The board of governors must restore credibility | publisher=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] | work=post-gazette.com | date=May 16, 2008 | accessdate=April 26, 2012 | author=Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noting in a December 2011 editorial that the magazine ''[[Esquire]]'' had promoted Heather Bresch as an "American hero" owing to her support for a pharma safety law, the ''Huntington News'' pointed out that the law also protected U.S. pharma firms like Mylan and suggested that the article was a "public makeover" engineered by "the Manchin public relations machine." It also said that Mylan "must have the only corporate Board of Directors in the country that doesn't care about one of their top execs being proven to have a phony MBA degree."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EDITORIAL: The Manchin PR Machine Keeps Rollin'. But Who Buys It?|url=http://www.huntingtonnews.net/8650|website=Huntington News|accessdate=March 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Manchin's call for a war on drugs, particularly opioids, and his charge that "Big Pharma" had "targeted" his state, Manchin's daughter, as noted, is the CEO of Mylan, a pharmaceutical firm that produces opioids, and Manchin himself accepted "nearly $180,000 in donations from pharmaceutical companies between 2011 and 2016."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Siegel|first1=Zachary|title=West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin: We Need To Declare A War on Drugs|url=https://www.thefix.com/west-virginia-senator-joe-manchin-we-need-declare-war-drugs|website=the fix|accessdate=March 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016, ''[[Fortune Magazine]]'' and the ''[[Washington Post]]'' ran a total of three articles about the fact that the "CEO of the company at the center of the [[EpiPen]] controversy" was Manchin's daughter. The articles noted that skyrocketing EpiPen costs were "the next big flash point in the national debate over skyrocketing prescription drug prices," that Bresch had originally gotten her Mylan job through her father, and that her career had "risen along with her father's, a fact that has not gone unnoticed by her critics." A particular point of controversy was the fact that Bresch had transferred Mylan's official headquarters to the Netherlands, a tax dodge maneuver known as [[tax inversion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=WIECZNER|first1=Jen|title=The Truth About Mylan CEO's 'Heather Bresch Situation' and Her MBA|url=http://fortune.com/2016/08/26/epipen-mylan-ceo-interview-heather-bresch-mba/|website=Fortune|accessdate=March 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family lawsuit===
In a lawsuit filed in July 2014, Dr. John Manchin II, one of Joe Manchin's brothers, sued Joe Manchin and his other brother, Roch Manchin, over a $1.7 million loan. The lawsuit alleged that Joe and Roch Manchin borrowed the money to keep the doors open at the family-owned carpet business run by Roch, that no part of the loan had yet been repaid, and that the defendants had taken other measures to evade compensating John Manchin II for non-payment.&lt;ref name="ManchinBadLoan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jul/25/us-sen-joe-manchin-sued-by-brother-over-loan/|title=Joe Manchin sued by brother over loan|work=The Washingtion Times|accessdate=January 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. Manchin withdrew the suit on June 30, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gallagher|first1=Emily|publisher=The Times West Virginian|title=John Manchin drops lawsuit against two brothers|url=http://wvpress.org/news/john-manchin-drops-lawsuit-against-two-brothers/|website=West Virginia Press Association|accessdate=November 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manchin's coal interests===
In July 2011, the ''[[New York Times]]'' ran a long article headlined "Sen. Manchin Maintains Lucrative Ties to Family-Owned Coal Company." Manchin's 2009 and 2010 financial disclosures included major earnings from Enersystems Inc., "a coal brokerage that he helped run before his political star rose." Many senators earn business income, but Manchin is rare in that "he derives income from an industry while acting as one of its biggest boosters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=QUINONES|first1=MANUEL|last2=SCHOR|first2=ELANA|title=Sen. Manchin Maintains Lucrative Ties to Family-Owned Coal Company|url=https://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2011/07/26/26greenwire-sen-manchin-maintains-lucrative-ties-to-family-64717.html?pagewanted=all|website=The New York Times|accessdate=March 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skipping votes and convention===
On December 18, 2010, Manchin skipped the vote to repeal Don't Ask, Don't Tell and the vote on the [[DREAM Act]], regarding immigration. The [[National Republican Senatorial Committee]] criticized Manchin for attending a family Christmas gathering instead of voting on these important issues. "For a Senator who has only been on the job a few weeks," commented the NRSC, "Manchin's absence today, and the apparent lack of seriousness with which he takes the job he was elected to do, speaks volumes."&lt;ref name="Skip votes"&gt;{{cite news |title=Joe Manchin Skipped DREAM And DADT Votes For A Christmas Party|date=December 18, 2010 |publisher=[[Talking Points Memo]] |url=http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/12/joe-manchin-skipped-dream-and-dadt-votes-for-a-christmas-party.php?ref=fpi}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Washington Post'' reported that he was the only Senate Democrat to miss these votes "on two of his party's signature pieces of legislation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joe Manchin absent for two major Senate votes|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2010/12/joe-manchin-absent-for-dream-a.html|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=May 4, 2012|author=Felicia Sonmez|date=December 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 2012, Manchin also skipped the Democratic National Convention, saying he planned "to spend this fall focused on the people of West Virginia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hamby|first1=Peter|last2=Killough|first2=Ashley|title=Manchin to skip Democratic National Convention|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/06/18/manchin-to-skip-democratic-national-convention/|website=political ticker - CNN|accessdate=March 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

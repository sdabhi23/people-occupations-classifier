'''Craig Kilborn''' (born August 24, 1962) is an American comedian, sports and political commentator, actor, and television host. He was the first host of ''[[The Daily Show]]'', a former anchor on [[ESPN]]'s ''[[SportsCenter]]'', and [[Tom Snyder]]'s successor on [[CBS]]' ''[[The Late Late Show (U.S.)|The Late Late Show]]''. On June 28, 2010, he launched ''The Kilborn File'' after a six-year absence from television. ''The Kilborn File'' aired on some [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] stations during a six-week trial run. In comedy, he is known for his [[deadpan]] delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1997/05/31/the-deadpan-zone/19556021-fad9-4d08-b1b3-adf8075833fc/|title=The Deadpan Zone|last=Lel|first=Richard|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=31 May 1997|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
The son of Shirley, a school teacher, and Hiram Kilborn, an insurance executive, Craig Kilborn was born in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] and moved to [[Hastings, Minnesota]], where he was raised, at four years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/14/Craig-Kilborn.html |title=Craig Kilborn Biography (1962-) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kilborn was taller than his peers from an early age, standing out on the playground and then the basketball court as he got older, eventually growing to 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m).&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jun/28/entertainment/la-et-craig-kilborn-20100628|title=Craig Kilborn breaks his silence - Los Angeles Times|last=Flint|first=Joe|date=2010-06-28|accessdate=2012-05-30|publisher=Articles.latimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 9th grade, Kilborn was recruited by the Northside Magicians, an all-star basketball team in [[Minneapolis]]. He excelled with the Magicians and with the team at [[Hastings High School (Minnesota)|Hastings High School]] as well, earning three letters and multiple all-conference and all-state honors. After graduation, he accepted a scholarship to play for [[Montana State University]], where he earned dual bachelor's degrees in theater arts and media in 1984.&lt;ref name=mslacat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mslacat.wordpress.com/2010/05/20/where-are-they-now-craig-kilborn/ |publisher=Mslacat's Blog |title=Where are they now: Craig Kilborn |date=May 20, 2010 |accessdate=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=throntw&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page3/story?page=minkoff/040213 |work=ESPN Page 3 |title=Kilborn thrown to the Wolves |date=February 13, 2004 |accessdate=September 4, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904133549/http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page3/story?page=minkoff%2F040213 |archivedate=September 4, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=arguy&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6bAKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PE0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1991%2C30690 |newspaper=Daily Courier |location=Prescott, Arizona |agency=Associated Press |title=Kilborn was an 'all right' guy, says former coach |date=April 1, 1999 |page=6A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dedshw&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DItOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6x4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3539%2C2572195 |newspaper=Sunday Star-News |location=Wilmington, North Carolina |title=Craig Kilborn: Host to dedicate show to alma mater |date=March 11, 2001 |page=2A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

=== Sports ===
Kilborn began his television career in [[California]] as the sports anchor for [[Monterey County, California|Monterey County]]'s [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate [[KCBA]] in [[Salinas, California|Salinas]]. Some of his on-air work included covering the [[Gilroy Garlic Festival]] and playing [[bocce]] with the locals near [[Cannery Row]]. Kilborn lived in nearby [[Carmel-by-the-Sea]]. Prior to KCBA, Kilborn was the CBA [[Savannah Spirits]]'s play-by-play radio commentator in 1986 and 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nba/story/7556424?CMP=OTC-K9B140813162&amp;ATT=73 |title=FOX Sports on MSN - NBA - Focused O'Neal, Tinsley can carry Pacers |publisher=Msn.foxsports.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-30 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''SportsCenter''====
{{main|SportsCenter}}
After several small jobs, Kilborn became an [[ESPN]] ''[[SportsCenter]]'' [[anchorman|anchor]] from 1993 to 1996. He was primarily the anchor of the late broadcast of ''SportsCenter'' which he coined "The Feel Good Edition". His numerous catch phrases included "Release, Rotation, Splash", "Jumanji", and "Oh, Precious". He made a return appearance to ''SportsCenter'' on August 8, 2004, when he co-hosted ''SportsCenter'' with [[Dan Patrick]] during [[ESPN25|ESPN's 25th Anniversary Celebration]].

=== Late-night hosting ===

====''The Daily Show''====
{{main|The Daily Show}}
In 1996, Kilborn became host of ''The Daily Show'' on [[Comedy Central]]. During his three-year tenure, ''The Daily Show'' was named "Best Late Night Comedy" by ''[[TV Guide]]''. Kilborn was also nominated for a [[CableACE Award]] for Outstanding Entertainment Host. Popular features Kilborn created at ''The Daily Show'' include: "5 Questions", "Moment for Us", "Dance, Dance, Dance", and "Your Moment of Zen" (a feature continued by later hosts).

In a 1997 interview with ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', Kilborn made jokes regarding ''Daily Show'' co-creator and head writer [[Lizz Winstead]], saying, "To be honest, Lizz does find me very attractive. If I wanted her to blow me, she would."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Colton | first = Michael | title = Lizz Winstead Returns ... and So Does Marv | url = http://www.observer.com/1999/lizz-winstead-returns-and-so-does-marv | date = 1999-04-04 | work = The New York Observer | accessdate = 2010-01-17 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100908164854/http://www.observer.com/1999/lizz-winstead-returns-and-so-does-marv | archivedate = 2010-09-08 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kilborn apologized publicly and pointed out that the remarks were "said in jest", but he was suspended for a week.

In 1998, [[CBS]] and [[David Letterman]]'s production company, [[Worldwide Pants]], selected Kilborn to replace [[Tom Snyder]] as host of ''[[The Late Late Show (U.S.)|The Late Late Show]]'' to run after ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''.  His final ''Daily Show'' episode aired on December 17, 1998, ending a 386-episode tenure. On January 11, 1999, [[Jon Stewart]] replaced Kilborn as host of ''The Daily Show''.

On August 6, 2015,  he made a cameo appearance on ''The Daily Show'' as part of Jon Stewart's last episode. It was his first appearance on the show since he left as host.

====''The Late Late Show''====
{{main|The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn}}
Kilborn hosted ''The Late Late Show'' for five years, changing the format to appeal to a younger audience. On the show, he popularized segments such as "Yambo" and "5 Questions". He created several characters, including Sebastian, the Asexual Icon.  He also narrated his own introduction and would enter to the sound of the song "[[Play That Funky Music]]" at the beginning of his show.

In August 2004, he elected not to extend his contract, referring to it as "early retirement". In a 2010 interview with the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' Kilborn said "I didn't leave to do anything else, I left to leave. I achieved my career goals and it wasn't all it was cracked up to be."

In a June 2010 interview, promoting his new show ''The Kilborn File'', Kilborn stated that he left late night television due to his thinking that the late night timeslot was "crowded" and "the formats repetitive" and that he wanted to be part of "the first comedy show at dinner time". Kilborn's last episode of ''The Late Late Show'' aired on August 27, 2004.  The Scottish-born American comedian [[Craig Ferguson]] took over the show on January 3, 2005."&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="latenight"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxcZH5v9iUw|title=Craig Kilborn on Good Day LA (The Kilborn File)|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=2010-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''The Kilborn File''====
Craig Kilborn returned to television on June 28, 2010 after six years off the air, when his new half-hour show ''The Kilborn File'' debuted on select Fox stations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/452872-Fox_to_Test_Kilborn_in_Seven_Markets_This_Summer.php Fox to Test Kilborn in Seven Markets This Summer] ''Broadcasting &amp; Cable'' May 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The show aired for a six-week test run on a 7:00&amp;nbsp;pm time slot in most markets, but was not well received.&lt;ref name="kilbornratings"&gt;[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/455616-Five_Weeks_In_Kilborn_Ratings_Stand_Still.php Five Weeks In, 'Kilborn' Ratings Stand Still] ''Broadcasting &amp; Cable'' August 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christine Lakin]] was his sidekick. The show brought back many of the hallmark segments from his time on ''The Daily Show'' and ''The Late Late Show,'' such as "5 Questions" and a segment similar to "Yambo" (with some minor rule changes and a name change to "Kilbo" and later to "Kilbyashi").&lt;ref name="kilbo"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAfQwXfgCHM The Kilborn File - Alex Meraz 2/2] ''YouTube'' July 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kilbyashi"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I62Whv24qd4 The Kilborn File - Mia Wasikowska 2/2] ''YouTube'' July 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The show was not renewed.

===Other work===
In 2003, Kilborn had a role in the movie ''[[Old School (film)|Old School]]'', as "Mark", the philandering boyfriend of [[Ellen Pompeo]]'s character. In the 2006 film ''[[The Benchwarmers]]'', Kilborn played Jerry, the bully to [[Jon Heder]], [[David Spade]], and [[Rob Schneider]]'s nerdy roles. In 2011, Kilborn played the villain in an episode of the television show ''[[Chuck (TV series)|Chuck]]'' during its final season.

Kilborn guest hosted ''[[The Artie Lange Show]]'' on November 6–8, 2013. 

He appeared in a TV commercial for [[Kraft Macaroni &amp; Cheese]] in 2016.

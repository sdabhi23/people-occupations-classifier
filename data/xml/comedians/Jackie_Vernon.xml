'''Jackie Vernon''' (born '''Ralph Verrone'''; March 29, 1924 – November 10, 1987) was an American stand-up comedian and actor who is best known for his role as the voice of Frosty the Snowman in the [[Rankin/Bass Productions]] Christmas special ''[[Frosty the Snowman (TV program)|Frosty the Snowman]]'' and its sequel ''[[Frosty's Winter Wonderland]]''.

==Biography==
Vernon was known for his gentle, low-key delivery and self-deprecating humor. He has been hailed as "The King of [[Deadpan]]." His signature opening line was, "To look at me now, it's hard to believe I was once considered a dull guy."

Early on in the 1950s, according to [[Dick Brooks (entertainer)|Dick Brooks]], Vernon bounced around the country working whatever jobs he could find, mostly in strip joints. Even then he had a unique style, often cracking up members of the band with his inside humor. He decided to give New York a try, and hung around Hanson's Drug Store, a place where small-time comedians and acts in the theater section of New York would meet after making the rounds of agents who had their offices in the area. He was picked up by manager of comedians Willie Weber. In 1963, [[Steve Allen]] invited Jackie to appear on his late-night television show, ''[[The Steve Allen Show#Syndication|Celebrity Talent Scouts]]'', and his career went into overdrive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/11/obituaries/jackie-vernon-62-comic-in-television-film-and-nightclubs.html |title=Jackie Vernon, 62; Comic in Television, Film and Nightclubs |first=Andrew L. |last=Yarrow |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 11, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, Jackie occasionally worked as the opening act for both  [[Dean Martin]] and [[Judy Garland]] and was a regular fixture on ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'', where he informed the host that his original stage name had been "Nosmo King," which he had seen on a sign (i.e. "no smoking"). He would take up a topic like [[prisons]] in a monologue and begin with, "Hello, prison fans." {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Vernon was also known to perform unique and darker sketches, such as his ultimately tragic attempt to turn a [[watermelon]] into a housepet. Plagued by strange occurrences and misfortune, Jackie would tell of traveling all the way to see the [[Grand Canyon]], only to find it was closed. Then there was the time he went to see a fistfight, and it broke out into a hockey game. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

One of his early bits was the "Vacation Slide Show." There were no slides visible; they were presumably offscreen as he described them, using a hand-clicker to advance to each "slide":
:(click) Here I am, tossing coins at the toll booth.
:(click) Here I am, under the car, looking for the coins.
:(click) Here I am, picking up a hitchhiker.
:(click) Here I am, hitchhiking.
:(click) Here's the hitchhiker picking me up with my own car. Luckily, she didn't recognize me.

A typical joke of Vernon's: "We lived in a small town built on a one-way street. If you miss it you have to drive all the way around the world to get back"

Vernon was once a [[trumpet]] player and often carried a [[cornet]] with him as a prop during his stand-up routines. As with [[Henny Youngman]] and his violin, it was seldom actually played. When he guested on a summer variety program hosted by [[Al Hirt]] in 1965, he came on with his cornet and said, "I play like I'm Hirt." He was a popular figure on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' and other variety shows, where he often ended his act by blowing a cornet and saying, "I think I hurt myself!" {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

He often appeared on the "[[The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast|Celebrity Roasts]]" that were a staple of 1970s television, as well as being a fixture on the dais at the original live [[The Friars Club|Friars Club Roasts]] before and after the televised versions. Vernon's signature "deadpan" expression and delivery often had the roast audiences laughing hysterically, long before the punch line of the jokes. Vernon's X-rated story-style jokes about people engaging in extreme sexual depravity became legend, often with the added tag line, "and I thought to myself... what a neat guy!" {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Vernon also memorably starred in Wayne Berwick's 1983 cult film ''[[Microwave Massacre]]'', in which he plays a lascivious builder who kills his wife for bossing him around and making him too many microwaved "gourmet" meals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.twincities.com/2016/12/22/cult-hit-reawakens-interest-in-south-st-paul-moviemaker/ |title=Cult hit reawakens interest in South St. Paul moviemaker |first=Chris |last=Hewitt |newspaper=[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]] |date=December 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charlie Chaplin===
Vernon said that for the first few years after starting standup, he would write letters to his hero [[Charlie Chaplin]], although he never got a reply or any acknowledgement of his letter-writing. After Vernon became famous and was making TV appearances, he eventually stopped writing Chaplin. During an appearance in Las Vegas, management told him that Charlie Chaplin would be in the audience that night; Jackie asked if he could meet Chaplin. He was told that Chaplin was eating dinner right then in the restaurant. Vernon walked up to Chaplin's table, and as he started to introduce himself, Chaplin interrupted him, saying, "Of course, Jackie Vernon. Tell me: why did you stop writing?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cerf |first=Bennett |author-link=Bennett Cerf |title=Try and Stop Me |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1734&amp;dat=19670417&amp;id=VtsbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Q1EEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2270,3298018 |newspaper=[[The Dispatch (Lexington)|The Dispatch]] |date=April 17, 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frosty the Snowman===
Despite his reputation as a raunchy comedian, Vernon also supplied the voice of the title character of the popular [[Rankin-Bass]] [[television]] special ''[[Frosty the Snowman (TV program)|Frosty the Snowman]]'' (1969), which has been broadcast annually on [[CBS]] since its debut. He later voiced Frosty in two more Rankin-Bass specials; ''[[Frosty's Winter Wonderland]]'' (1976) and ''[[Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July]]'' (1979).

==Death==
Vernon died at home in [[Hollywood, California]] on November 10, 1987 from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at age 63. He was survived by his wife, Hazel, and three children.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-11-11/news/mn-13604_1_jackie-vernon |title= Vernon, Stage and TV Comedian, Dies at 63 |first=Burt A. |last=Folkart |date=November 11, 1987 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/latimes/obituary.aspx?page=lifestory&amp;pid=17403187 |title=Hazel Vernon Obituary |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=April 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

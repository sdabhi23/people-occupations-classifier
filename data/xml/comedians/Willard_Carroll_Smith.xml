==Early life==
Smith was born on September 25, 1968 in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], to Caroline (Bright), a Philadelphia school board administrator, and Willard Carroll Smith Sr.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terryfuneralhome.com/obituary/Willard-C.-Smith-Sr./Philadelphia-PA/1669675|title=Willard C.

He grew up in West Philadelphia's [[Wynnefield, Philadelphia|Wynnefield]] neighborhood,&lt;ref name="Schuman"/&gt; and was raised [[Baptist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Strauss|first=Bob|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ent/movies/5377381.html|title=Will Smith on power, dogs and Cruise|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|date=December 14, 2007|accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has three siblings, sister Pamela, who is four years older, and twins Harry and Ellen, who are three years younger.&lt;ref name="Schuman"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schuman |first=Michael |date=January 1, 2013 |title=Will Smith: A Biography of a Rapper Turned Movie Star |publisher=Enslow Publishers, Inc. |pages=9–10 |isbn=9780766039940}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith attended Our Lady of Lourdes, a private Catholic elementary school in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name="Iannucci"&gt;{{cite book |last=Iannucci |first=Lisa |date=2010 |title=Will Smith: A Biography |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |pages=4–10 |isbn=9780313376108}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents separated when he was 13,&lt;ref name="Keegan"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1689234,00.html|work=Time|author=Rebecca Winters Keegan|title=The Legend of Will Smith|registration=yes|date=November 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but did not actually divorce until around 2000.&lt;ref name="itas"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Will Smith|series=Inside the Actors Studio|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdaiFOFfeTQ|credits=James Lipton (producer)|network=Bravo|season=8|number=806|airdate=2002-01-13|accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith attended [[Overbrook High School (Philadelphia)|Overbrook High School]].&lt;ref name="Iannucci"/&gt; While it has been widely reported that Smith turned down a scholarship to attend the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), he never applied to college because he "wanted to rap."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.07/smith.html|title=I, Robocop|date=December 2007|author=Jennifer Hillner|journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|volume=46|issue=8|pages=833–9|pmid=18509686|doi=10.1007/s11517-008-0355-6|last2=Wu|first2=JS|last3=Hyland|first3=B|last4=Lu|first4=XD|last5=Chen|first5=JJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Smith says he was admitted to a "pre-engineering [summer] program" at MIT for high school students, but he did not attend.&lt;ref name="itas"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/massachusetts-institute-technology/1015777-it-seems-as-if-will-smith-was-accepted-to-mites.html|title=It seems as if Will Smith was accepted to MITES|accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://engineering.mit.edu/programs/mites|title=Minority Introduction to Engineering and Science (MITES)|accessdate=August 24, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150812062025/http://engineering.mit.edu/programs/mites|archivedate=August 12, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Smith, "My mother, who worked for the [[School District of Philadelphia|School Board of Philadelphia]], had a friend who was the admissions officer at MIT. I had pretty high [[SAT]] scores and [[Affirmative action in the United States|they needed black kids]], so I probably could have gotten in.

==Career==

===1985–1992: The Fresh Prince===
[[File:Will Smith - Emmy Awards 1993.jpg|thumb|right|Smith at the Emmy Awards in 1993]]

Smith started as the [[MC#Hip hop|MC]] of the hip-hop duo [[DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; The Fresh Prince]], with his childhood friend [[DJ Jazzy Jeff|Jeffrey "DJ Jazzy Jeff" Townes]] as [[turntablist]] and producer.&lt;ref name=tca&gt;Stated on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'', 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Townes and Smith were introduced to each other by chance in 1985, as Townes was performing at a house party only a few doors down from Smith's residence, and he was missing his [[hype man]]. Smith decided to fill in. They both felt strong chemistry, and Townes was upset when his hype man finally made it to the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DJ Jazz Jeff Interview Made From Scratch |publisher=DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince Fan Site |url=http://www.jazzyjefffreshprince.com/interviews/dj-jazzy-jeff/jazzy-jeff-made-from-scratch.htm |accessdate=2008-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516163814/http://www.jazzyjefffreshprince.com/interviews/dj-jazzy-jeff/jazzy-jeff-made-from-scratch.htm |archivedate=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after, the two decided to join forces. Smith enlisted a friend to join as the beatboxer of the group, Clarence Holmes (Ready Rock C), making them a trio. Philadelphia-based Word Up Records released their first single in late 1985 to 1986 when [[A&amp;R]] man [[Paul Oakenfold]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Paul-Oakenfold-Biography/887820CD0D81734B48256C3200095A8C Paul Oakenfold] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429072412/http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Paul-Oakenfold-Biography/887820CD0D81734B48256C3200095A8C |date=2008-04-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced them to Word Up with their single "[[Girls Ain't Nothing but Trouble]]," a tale of funny misadventures that landed Smith and his former DJ and rap partner Mark Forrest (Lord Supreme) in trouble.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071201090331/http://members.aol.com/ProfQuater/Jazzy.html Champion Records]&lt;/ref&gt; The song [[sample (music)|sampled]] the theme song of "[[I Dream of Jeannie]]." Smith became known for light-hearted story-telling raps and capable, though profanity-free, "battle" rhymes. The single became a hit a month before Smith graduated from high school.&lt;ref name=sickening&gt;{{cite news |title = Will Smith: My Work Ethic Is "Sickening" |publisher = CBS |url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/11/30/60minutes/main3558937_page2.shtml |accessdate = 2008-05-14 |date=2007-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Based on this success, the duo were brought to the attention of [[Jive Records]] and [[Russell Simmons]]. The duo's first album, ''[[Rock the House (album)|Rock the House]]'', which was first released on Word Up in 1986 debuted on Jive in  March of [[1987 in music|1987]]. The group received the first [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance]] in 1989 for "[[Parents Just Don't Understand]]" (1988), though their most successful single was "[[Summertime (DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; The Fresh Prince song)|Summertime]]" (1991), which earned the group their second Grammy and peaked at number 4 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Smith and Townes are still friends and claim that they never split up, having made songs under Smith's solo performer credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince to reunite? |publisher=://URLFan |url=http://www.urlfan.com/local/dj_jazzy_jeff_and_the_fresh_prince_to_reunite/76504345.html |accessdate=2008-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080707061753/http://www.urlfan.com/local/dj_jazzy_jeff_and_the_fresh_prince_to_reunite/76504345.html |archivedate=July 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith spent money freely around 1988 and 1989 and underpaid his income taxes.&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; The [[Internal Revenue Service]] eventually assessed a $2.8 million tax debt against Smith, took many of his possessions, and [[garnishment|garnished]] his income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|first=Will|last=Smith|interviewer=[[Steve Kroft]]|title=60 Minutes|publisher=CBS|date=December 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Smith was nearly bankrupt in 1990, when the [[NBC]] television network signed him to a contract and built a sitcom, ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'', around him.&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; The show was successful and began his acting career. Smith set for himself the goal of becoming "the biggest movie star in the world", studying [[List of highest-grossing films|box office successes]]' common characteristics.&lt;ref name="Keegan" /&gt;

===1993–2006: Solo music and film beginnings===
Smith's first major roles were in the drama ''[[Six Degrees of Separation (film)|Six Degrees of Separation]]'' (1993) and the action film ''[[Bad Boys (1995 film)|Bad Boys]]'' (1995) in which he starred opposite [[Martin Lawrence]]. The latter film was commercially successful, grossing $141,407,024 worldwide — $65,807,024 in North America and $75,600,000 overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Bad Boys (1995) |url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=badboys.htm |work = [[Box Office Mojo]] |publisher = [[Internet Movie Database]] |accessdate = August 12, 2010 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100730100826/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=badboys.htm| archivedate=July 30, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, critical reception was generally mixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Bad Boys (1995) |url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1062483-bad_boys/ |work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher = [[Flixster]] |accessdate = August 12, 2010 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100731014227/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1062483-bad_boys/#trailers| archivedate=July 31, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Smith starred as part of an ensemble cast in [[Roland Emmerich]]'s ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]''. The film was a massive blockbuster, becoming the second highest-grossing film in history at the time and establishing Smith as a prime box office draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=independenceday.htm |title=Independence Day |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date= |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

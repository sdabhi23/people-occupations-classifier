His improvised musical sets are created using only his voice, a keyboard, and a looping machine. Watts refers to himself as a "disinformationist," aiming to disorient his audiences. He appeared on the [[IFC (U.S. TV channel)|IFC]] series ''[[Comedy Bang! Bang! (TV series)|Comedy Bang! Bang!]]'', which began airing in 2012. He currently leads the [[house band]] for ''[[The Late Late Show with James Corden]]'' and hosts the US version of ''[[Taskmaster (US TV series)|Taskmaster]]''.&lt;ref name="SSart"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://splitsider.com/2014/12/cbs-announces-reggie-watts-will-be-late-late-shows-band-leader-next-year/|title=CBS Announces Reggie Watts Will Be 'Late Late Show's Band Leader Next Year|author=Wright, Megh|date=2014-12-12|work=[[Splitsider]]|accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Watts was born in [[Stuttgart]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/person/reggie-watts/biography.html |title=Reggie Watts Biography |accessdate=2012-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; the only child of Christiane and Charles Alphonso Watts. His mother is [[French people|French]] and his father is [[African American]].&lt;ref name=Esquire/&gt; His father was an officer in the [[United States Air Force]] and the family lived in Germany and Spain before relocating to [[Great Falls, Montana]], where Watts was raised and graduated from [[Great Falls High School]] in the class of 1990.&lt;ref name=Esquire/&gt; Watts also took piano and violin lessons from the age of five until he was 16,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montrealmirror.com/2005/111005/music1.html |title=Soulful absurdity: The two sides of Reggie Watts|author=Scott C|date=2005-10-16|work=[[Montreal Mirror]]|accessdate=2011-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has said his love for music started as a young child when he saw [[Ray Charles]] playing the piano on television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soundbutt.com/employeeofthemonthshow/reggiewatts|title=Reggie Watts on Employee of the Month|publisher=SoundButt}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Watts moved to [[Seattle, Washington]] in 1990 at the age of 18 to study music. He briefly attended [[the Art Institute of Seattle]] before studying jazz at [[Cornish College of the Arts]].&lt;ref name="STinterview" /&gt; While in Seattle, he played in a number of Seattle bands of wildly varying genres, including Hit Explosion, Swampdweller, Action Buddy, Chiarrscuro, Clementine, Smell No Taste, [[Wayne Horvitz]] 4+1 Ensemble, Das Rut, Synthclub, Elemental, Eyvand Kang Seven Nades, and Free Space, amongst others.

==Career==

===Early career (1996{{ndash}}2009)===
In 1996, Watts became the front man for soul, rock, and hip hop group [[Maktub]].&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reggiewatts.com/bio |title=Reggie Watts Official Biography |publisher=Reggiewatts.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

While recording and touring circa 1996–2000 with [[Wayne Horvitz]] 4+1 Ensemble as a keyboardist, Watts was forced to downsize his effects pedal from a [[Roland Space Echo]] tape delay to a [[Line 6 (company)|Line 6]] [[Line 6 DL4|DL4]] delay modeler, a smaller device that makes it easy to travel. He began using the Line 6 in live shows with [[Maktub]], in order to replicate the duplicate harmonies from the recorded material. Then, he experimented with improvising entire songs in solo acts with the Line 6, while trying to sound like [[Tom Waits]], playing initial gigs at small Seattle venues and artist bungalows. While in Seattle, Watts composed musical scores for Northwest dance choreographers and he dabbled in sketch comedy with future theatrical collaborator [[Tommy Smith (playwright)|Tommy Smith]].&lt;ref name="SunBreak"&gt;{{cite news|last=Barker|first=Jeremy M.|title=Reggie Watts &amp; Tommy Smith's Long Road Back to on the Boards|url=http://thesunbreak.com/2009/10/14/reggie-watts-tommy-smiths-long-road-back-to-on-the-boards/|newspaper=[[The SunBreak]]|date=October 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, after recording five albums over eight years, Watts moved to the [[Lower East Side]], New York City. In 2005, he recorded his first solo single, "So Beautiful". Inspired by ''[[The State (1993 TV series)|The State]]'' and ''[[Wet Hot American Summer]]'', he began infusing spontaneous comedic material with the beat-box-driven musical compositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Klickstein|first=Mathew|title=Reggie Watts, Conan O'Brien's hip-hop comic coming to the Fox|url=http://www.coloradodaily.com/ci_18657736?source%3Dmost_viewed#axzz1wEFwFuu2|newspaper=Colorado Daily|date=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He shot comedic web shorts for Superdeluxe, [[Vimeo]] and [[CollegeHumor]].

In 2006, Watts started to branch out into performing for television and film, while continuing to pursue live performance and the creation of new performance technologies. {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

In 2007, Watts appeared on [[Plum TV]]'s "Scott Bateman Presents Scott Bateman Presents" and starred in the [[CollegeHumor]] internet video "What About Blowjobs?" The video became a viral hit. The same year, he also wrote and performed the theme song for ''[[Penelope Princess of Pets]]'', a web comedy series featuring [[Kristen Schaal]] and [[H. Jon Benjamin]].

In 2008, Watts recorded a new special entitled "Disinformation", which features his performance at the Under the Radar Festival at the Public Theater. He also appeared in the independent film "Steel of Fire Warriors 2010 A.D." as a Mutantzoid Underling and on an episode of ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'', as well as making other various television appearances.

In 2009, Watts recorded his first solo EP, ''Pot Cookies''. He also began appearing on the [[PBS Kids]]' children's program, "[[The Electric Company (2009 TV series)|The Electric Company]]". Watts performed in his first solo short film "Watts Does London" and made a small appearance on Comedy Central's [[Michael and Michael Have Issues]]. He then did voice work for an episode of [[Adult Swim (UK &amp; Ireland)|Adult Swim]]'s ''[[The Venture Bros.]]'' as "The Delivery Guy", Australia's "[[Good News Week]]", and appeared in the UK documentary ''[[The Yes Men Fix the World]]''. Watts also toured in direct support of [[Devo]] in a fall 2009 tour which featured that band's albums ''[[Are We Not Men? We Are Devo!|Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!]]'' and ''[[Freedom of Choice (album)|Freedom of Choice]]'' played in full.

===''Why Shit So Crazy?'' (2010{{ndash}}2011)===
In 2010, Waverly Films shot a one-hour special on Watts called ''[[Why Shit So Crazy?]]''. The special features Watts in live performance at New York venues Galapagos, The Bellhouse, and [[(Le) Poisson Rouge]], bookended with brief sketches and a music video of Watts' "Fuck Shit Stack". [[Comedy Central]] aired ''Why Shit So Crazy?'' and released the film as a dual DVD/CD package.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|last=Itzkoff|first=Dave|authorlink=Dave Itzkoff|title=Always the Quick-Change Artist, From Skits to Songs to Stand-Ups|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/29/arts/television/29reggie.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, Watts made various public appearances, including in [[Conan O'Brien]]'s ''[[The Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour]]''.

===''A Live in Central Park'' (2012)===
Watts's second stand-up special, ''Reggie Watts: A "Live" in Central Park'', premiered on May 12, 2012 on Comedy Central in the "Secret Stash" completely uncensored to positive reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hyman|first=Dan|title=Reggie Watts: 'I Feel That I Need to Make Something More Substantial'|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/reggie-watts-i-feel-that-i-need-to-make-something-more-substantial-20120522|newspaper=Rolling Stone|date=May 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=L.

The film was made available as a CD/DVD through Watts' official website as well as Comedy Central's online store.

Soon afterwards, Watts performed a song with [[LCD Soundsystem]] on their farewell documentary movie, ''[[Shut Up and Play the Hits]]''.

===''Comedy Bang! Bang!'' (2012{{ndash}}2015)===
[[File:Reggie Watts 2013.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Reggie Watts at [[The Super Serious Show]], March 2013]]
In 2012, Watts began starring opposite [[Scott Aukerman]] on the [[IFC (U.S. TV channel)|IFC]] series ''[[Comedy Bang! Bang! (TV series)|Comedy Bang! Bang!]]'', based on the comedy podcast of the same name (formerly ''[[Comedy Death-Ray Radio]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blackard|first=Cap|title=Interview: Reggie Watts|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2012/05/interview-reggie-watts/|newspaper=Consequence of Sound|date=May 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2012, Watts began collaborating with [[Michael Cera]], [[Tim &amp; Eric]], and [[Sarah Silverman]] to create their comedy [[YouTube channel]] known as [[Jash]].&lt;ref name="USA Today Introduces Jash"&gt;{{cite news|last=Matheson|first=Whitney|title=JASH: Your fave comedians launch a YouTube channel|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/popcandy/2013/03/11/jash-youtube/1978521/|accessdate=11 March 2013|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=2013-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Danton|first=Eric R.|title=Sarah Silverman, Michael Cera Launch JASH Comedy Channel on YouTube|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/videos/sarah-silverman-michael-cera-launch-jash-comedy-channel-on-youtube-20130311|accessdate=11 March 2013|newspaper=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=2013-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, On The Boards recorded a new Watts special entitled ''Transition'', which played at various arts festivals including the [[Under the Radar Festival]] at [[The Public Theater]]; it was winner of the MAP Fund Award and Creative Capital award. It is available on iTunes via TenduTV.

Watts was invited to perform at Yoko Ono's [[Meltdown (festival)|Meltdown]] 2013 on the South Bank in London where he was supported by&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whatson/reggie-watts-mac-lethal-74208|title=Reggie Watts + Mac Lethal|work=southbankcentre.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mac Lethal]].

In 2014, Watts contributed the outro vocal on "Holy City" and beatbox on "The Classic" from the [[Joan As Police Woman]] album [[The Classic (Joan as Police Woman album)|''The Classic'']]. He also appeared as the last act in the season 4 premiere of ''[[John Oliver's New York Stand-Up Show]]'' where he told some jokes and performed a song, hugging John Oliver at the end.

In December 2014, following CBS's announcement that Watts would lead ''The Late Late Show'' band, Aukerman announced that Watts would remain with ''Comedy Bang! Bang!'' through only the first half of 2015.&lt;ref name="SSart" /&gt; Watts' final episode of ''Comedy Bang! Bang!'' was on June 5, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2015/02/19/comedy-bang-bang-passes-the-mic-to-kid-cudi-71305/20150219ifc01/&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Late Late Show with James Corden'' (2015{{ndash}}present)===
Watts currently serves as the bandleader and announcer for ''[[The Late Late Show with James Corden]]''. He has described his role on the show as "... a mix of [[Paul Shaffer]] and [[Andy Richter]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kavner|first1=Lucas|title=Reggie Watts on His New Gig As Bandleader of The Late Late Show and Why He Was Initially Annoyed by the Offer|url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/03/reggie-watts-late-late-show-bandleader.html|publisher=Vulture|accessdate=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His band on the show is unofficially named "Karen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Daly|first1=Kyle|title=Reggie Watts' Late Late Show band is just called Karen|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/reggie-watts-late-late-show-band-just-called-karen-216960|publisher=AV Club|accessdate=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watts has a slot on the show to ask a guest a question about anything (called Reggie's Question on show clips).  The questions are a continuation of his time on ''Comedy Bang! Bang!'', and follow his preference for surreal comedy in his stand-up act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sandberg|first1=Bryn|title='Late Late Show' Bandleader Reggie Watts on Dual Role, 'Comedy Bang! Bang!' Influence|url=https://news.yahoo.com/show-bandleader-reggie-watts-dual-role-comedy-bang-040000475.html|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter/Yahoo|accessdate=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Watts' second Netflix special, ''Spatial'', was released on December 6, 2016.

==Performance style==
Watts's solo shows are completely improvised and consist of him singing and rapping both with words and with [[Sound poetry]], accompanying himself by either [[beatboxing]], performing vocal basslines into a loop machine, or simply by playing the keyboard. His act also showcases his trademark style of [[standup comedy]], consisting of him rapidly alternating between topics of discussion in both rational and nonsensical manners, making random sounds and noises, and speaking in other accents and languages at unexpected times, all with the intent of playfully and comically disorienting his audiences.&lt;ref name="guardian review"&gt;{{cite web|title=Reggie Watts – review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/jun/19/reggie-watts-review|last=Logan|first=Brian|date=19 June 2013|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

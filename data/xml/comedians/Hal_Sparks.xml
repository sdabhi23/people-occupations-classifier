After a [[Twitter]] campaign to encourage the "real Zoltan" to appear at a game, Sparks flew to [[Pittsburgh]] on July 25, 2012, to throw out the honorary first pitch, and was on hand to see the Pirates win 3-2 over his hometown team, the [[Chicago Cubs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Majors|first=Dan|title=Actor who played Zoltan on hand for Pirates win |url=http://old.post-gazette.com/pg/12208/1249427-63.stm#ixzz21o9AtWED|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=July 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite picking up a cult following in Pittsburgh&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/sports/pirates/the-pirates-believe-in-the-power-of-zoltan-643203/ | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | first=Dan | last=Majors | title=The Pirates believe in the power of Zoltan - Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | date=July 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and helping the team contend in the playoff race well into September, the Pirates finished with a 79-83 record, extending their major North American professional sports record to 20 consecutive losing seasons.

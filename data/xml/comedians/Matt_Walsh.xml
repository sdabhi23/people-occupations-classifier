He also previously starred in short-lived comedy programs such as ''[[Dog Bites Man]]'' on [[Comedy Central]] and ''[[Players (2010 TV series)|Players]]'' on [[Spike TV]], and was a correspondent on ''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]''. He has also co-starred in films such as ''[[Ghostbusters (2016 film)|Ghostbusters]]'', ''[[Life of the Party (2018 film)|Life of the Party]]'', ''[[Ted (film)|Ted]]'', ''[[Into the Storm (2014 film)|Into the Storm]]'', ''[[Brigsby Bear]]'', and ''[[Old School (film)|Old School]]''.

==Early life==
Walsh was born in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref name=tvg /&gt;  &lt;!--the fourth of seven children of Dick and Audrey Walsh. He graduated from [[Hinsdale South High School]] in 1982. While in high school he played on the football team as a backup tight end. He attended [[Northern Illinois University]], where he graduated with a degree in [[Psychology]], also spending a year studying abroad in [[Austria]] at [[Salzburg College]].
--&gt;
==Career==
After college, Walsh took [[improvisational comedy]] classes in Chicago, where he would become a regular performer at the [[Annoyance Theater]] and [[ImprovOlympic]], where he studied under legendary improv teacher [[Del Close]]. In 1991, he met comedian [[Matt Besser]], with whom he began performing stand-up comedy. Along with [[Matt Besser]], [[Amy Poehler]], and [[Ian Roberts (American actor)|Ian Roberts]], he is a founding member of the [[Upright Citizens Brigade]] improv comedy troupe and played "Trotter" in the troupe's sketch comedy series, which ran for three seasons on [[Comedy Central]]. Before the show, the UCB comedy foursome had already been doing improv shows at their theatre in New York, which used to be a burlesque house before they remodeled it to become a theatre. To date, they have founded four successful Upright Citizens Brigade comedy theaters located in New York at UCB Chelsea and The East Village UCB, and Los Angeles with UCB Franklin and UCB Sunset.

Besides his sketch work with the Upright Citizens Brigade, Walsh is also known for his memorable supporting roles in popular comedy films in recent years including ''[[Cyrus (2010 comedy-drama film)|Cyrus]]'', ''[[Old School (film)|Old School]]'', ''[[The Hangover (film)|The Hangover]]'', ''[[Role Models]]'', and ''[[Semi-Pro]]''. Walsh also wrote and starred in the cult indie-comedy ''[[Martin &amp; Orloff]]'', which had a limited theatrical run in 2002 and 2003. In addition, he was also a correspondent on ''[[The Daily Show]]'' from 2001 to 2002, made regular appearances in comedy sketches on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' and [[MTV]]'s ''[[Human Giant]]'' as well as starring in the Comedy Central [[mockumentary]] series ''[[Dog Bites Man]]'' in the summer of 2006. Walsh has the distinction of having appeared in several [[Todd Phillips]] comedy films, most often playing characters aptly named "Walsh".

In 2010, Walsh created the improvised comedy series ''[[Players (2010 TV series)|Players]]'' for [[Spike TV]]. Walsh (creator, writer, director and executive producer of the show) stars in the series alongside his Upright Citizens Brigade partner [[Ian Roberts (American actor)|Ian Roberts]], as two brothers who run a sports bar together. The show aired for one season, concluding on August 14, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117999861.html?categoryid=1238&amp;cs=1|title=Spike TV greenlights 'Players'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walsh currently hosts the podcast [http://beardown.libsyn.com ''Bear Down''] with comedian [[Scot Armstrong]] (screenwriter of ''[[Old School (film)|Old School]]'') where they discuss their favorite football team [[Chicago Bears|The Chicago Bears]] and do sports-themed comedy bits such as fake call-ins and in-character interviews. The podcast has also featured appearances by comedians such as [[Horatio Sanz]], [[Ian Roberts (American actor)|Ian Roberts]], [[Joseph Nunez]], and [[Matt Price]].

In 2010, Walsh had recurring roles on the [[NBC]] comedy series ''[[Outsourced (TV series)|Outsourced]]'' and on the [[HBO]] comedy series ''[[Hung (TV series)|Hung]]''. In 2012, he began co-starring as Mike McLintock in the HBO series ''[[Veep]]'', for which he was nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series]] in 2016. During that year, Walsh portrayed [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] in ''[[The Dead Authors Podcast]]''.

Walsh directed his first feature film ''[[High Road (film)|High Road]]'', an indie-comedy he co-wrote with Josh Weiner. The film was released on March 6, 2012. Walsh co-wrote his second film, ''A Better You'', with [[Brian Huskey]], who also stars in the film.

In the movie ''[[Into the Storm (2014 film)|Into the Storm]]'', Walsh stars as Pete Moore, who is the driver of the [[Tornado Intercept Vehicle]] nicknamed "Titus."

He appeared in the MyCareer mode in the basketball simulation game, ''[[NBA 2K17]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/8/26/12654126/nba-2k17-prelude-trailer-mycareer-free-ps4-xbox-one|title=NBA 2K17 demo lets you start the career mode early, for free|last=Sarkar|first=Samit|date=2016-08-26|website=Polygon|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alan Graham Carr''' (born 14 June 1976{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}) is an English comedian and television personality.

Carr was born in [[Weymouth, Dorset]], and spent most of his childhood in [[Northampton]] before moving in his early 20s to [[Chorlton-cum-Hardy]], [[Manchester]], where he began his comedy career. Carr's breakthrough was in 2001, winning the ''[[City Life (magazine)|City Life]]'' Best Newcomer of the Year and the [[BBC New Comedy Award]]s.

In the ensuing years, his career burgeoned on the Manchester comedy circuit before he became well known for hosting ''[[The Sunday Night Project|The Friday Night Project]]'' with [[Justin Lee Collins]]. This led to the release of a short-lived entertainment show ''[[Alan Carr's Celebrity Ding Dong]]'' in 2008 and, eventually, his popular comedy chat show ''[[Alan Carr: Chatty Man]]'', which aired on [[Channel 4]] between 2009 and 2016.

Carr also hosted a radio show, ''[[Going Out with Alan Carr]]'', on [[BBC Radio 2]] for three years as well as releasing his autobiography ''[[Look Who It Is!]]'' (2008) and going on three arena tours: ''Tooth Fairy Live'' (2007), ''Spexy Beast Live'' (2011) and ''Yap, Yap, Yap!'' (2015).

Carr is represented by the agency [[Off the Kerb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artist Pages: Alan Carr | url = http://www.offthekerb.co.uk/alan-carr/|publisher=[[Off the Kerb]]|accessdate=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has won two [[British Comedy Awards]], two [[National Television Awards]] and a [[BAFTA TV Awards|BAFTA TV Award]].

==Personal life==
His father, whose family come from [[North East England]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/north-east-news/evening-chronicle-news/2011/05/07/comedian-alan-carr-back-to-his-north-east-roots-72703-28651980/ ''Evening Chronicle'' ]&lt;/ref&gt; is former [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]] manager and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] chief scout [[Graham Carr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work = bbc.co.uk/sport | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41015006 | title = 'Graham Carr: Ex-Newcastle chief scout takes director role at Northampton Town' | date = 22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work = [[The Guardian]] | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/20/gayrights.comedy | title = 'I couldn't be cool if I tried' | date = 20 November 2007  | accessdate = 6 March 2009 | location=London | first=Patrick | last=Barkham}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Carr has a younger brother, Gary.&lt;ref name="G int"/&gt;

After completing his degree in his early 20s, Carr moved to [[Manchester]], seeking a better life and aspiring to be a comedian. He moved into a house full of activity in [[Chorlton-cum-Hardy]] after which he moved to [[Stretford]]; which he cites as an inspiration for his comedic work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Life's no joke for camp Carr |url=http://www.citylife.co.uk/news_and_reviews/news/7404_life_s_no_joke_for_camp_carr |work=City Life |date=23 June 2005 |accessdate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carr soon became a regular on the Manchester comedy circuit, including ''Alan Carr's Ice Cream Sunday'' at the Manchester Comedy Store. Carr also made friends with fellow comedians based on the Manchester circuit, including [[Jason Manford]], [[Justin Moorhouse]] and [[John Bishop (comedian)|John Bishop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Alan Carr looks back on his early days on the Manchester comedy scene |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/tv_and_showbiz/s/1454830_alan-carr-looks-back-on-his-early-days-on-the-manchester-comedy-scene |work=[[Manchester Evening News]] |date=5 August 2011 |accessdate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carr is [[coming out|openly]] [[homosexual]], he does not consider his sexuality to be a focal part of his act, once saying, "I just think gay people need to get over themselves. Just because you're gay and on the telly doesn't mean you're a role model. I'm just a comedian. That's all I am. What am I meant to do? Do I go down the [[Julian Clary]] route and talk about [[fisting]] and [[poppers]]? I don't talk about being gay and I think what better equality for gays than that?"&lt;ref name="G int"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/apr/13/comedy.television|title= Elizabeth Day meets award-winning comedian Alan Carr|work=[[The Observer]] |accessdate=4 April 2009 |last=Day |first=Elizabeth | location=London | date=15 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018 Carr married his partner of ten years, Paul Drayton, in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42758515 |title=Alan Carr gets married to long-term boyfriend in LA |publisher=BBC |first= |last= |date=20 January 2018 |accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wedding was officiated by his close friend, singer-songwriter [[Adele]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-43632598|title=Adele 'got ordained to marry Alan Carr'|date=2018-04-03|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-04-03|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 September 2006, Carr and entertainer [[Lionel Blair]] helped save a man who was about to fall from a pier in [[Blackpool]]. The man was holding on by his fingertips, but the two men managed to pull him to safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/lancashire/5368936.stm|title=Entertainers in pier rescue drama|date=21 September 2006|accessdate=29 April 2007|publisher=[[BBC News]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070513050637/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/lancashire/5368936.stm| archivedate= 13 May 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carr said: "I've loved every minute of it but it's time to reclaim my weekends. I wish Radio 2 every success but I'll listen from my home in the future instead."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2111021/Alan-Carr-quits-Radio-2-concentrate-Chatty-Man.html?ito=feeds-newsxml | location=London | work=[[Daily Mail]] | title='I've loved every minute!'

For 4 weeks in January/February 2017 Alan again returned to Radio 2 to sit in for [[Paul O'Grady]] on his Sunday show. Carr reunited with Sykes to present a 10-week show called 'Summer Escapes' sitting in for [[Graham Norton]] on Saturdays from July till September 2017 on Radio 2. It was on air between 10{{nbsp}}am and 1{{nbsp}}pm and included features based around summer including the 'British Seaside Survey'.

==Performance==

He has been featured in three [[Edinburgh]] shows and in 2007 he toured throughout the UK, which was followed by a DVD entitled "Tooth Fairy Live".

==Controversy==
In December 2008, when accepting his award for Best Entertainment Personality at the [[British Comedy Awards]], Carr dedicated it to [[Kidnapping of Shannon Matthews|Karen Matthews]], who had earlier that month been found guilty of kidnapping [[Kidnapping of Shannon Matthews|Shannon Matthews]], her own daughter. Carr was quoted by [[BBC News]] as stating: "I should dedicate this award to her [Karen]. She would be my dream guest. I think she's a gay icon. People like a bit of rough, don't they?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/a137777/carr-sorry-over-comedy-award-dedication.html Carr sorry over comedy award dedication] ''[[Digital Spy]]''. 8 December 2008. Retrieved 23 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shahid Malik]], [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for Matthews' constituency of [[Dewsbury]], described Carr's comments about Shannon Matthews as "sick and insensitive". Carr subsequently apologised for his comments, saying "I realise what I said was insensitive and I am very sorry for any offence caused."&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | work = [[BBC News]] | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_yorkshire/7770323.stm | title = Comedian sorry for Matthews joke | date = 7 December 2008 | accessdate = 8 December 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081210040339/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_yorkshire/7770323.stm| archivedate=10 December 2008&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his own website he added: "For those of you who have enjoyed my comedy and seen my act over the last seven years you all would have got used to my tongue in cheek style and near the knuckle observations. Last night at the Comedy Awards [...] I was being ironic, these aren't my real sentiments obviously."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alancarr.net/diary/2008/12/apologies-all-round.html Apologies All Round] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201004432/http://www.alancarr.net/diary/2008/12/apologies-all-round.html |date=1 February 2009 }}. 8 December 2008.

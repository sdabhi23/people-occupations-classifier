'''Shaun Majumder''' (born January 29, 1972) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[actor]] and [[comedian]]. He is best known for his role on ''[[This Hour Has 22 Minutes]]''.

==Early life==
Majumder was raised in [[Burlington, Newfoundland and Labrador|Burlington]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Proud to be a Pewfie|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/proud-to-be-a-pewfie/article1333800|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|last=Gill|first=Alexandra|date=February 8, 2003|accessdate=April 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; by his mother Marian Bartlett, a European-Canadian woman from Newfoundland, and Mani Majumder, a [[Bengali Hindus|Bengali Hindu]] man, originally from [[West Bengal]]. His parents separated after seven years.&lt;ref name="Progress Media"&gt;http://www.progressmedia.ca/article/2012/08/manor-born{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Majumder has an older sister named Rani.&lt;ref name="Progress Media"/&gt;

Majumder has said that because he was raised by a white mother and around white people, he had no idea he "was anything but white".&lt;ref name="The Globe and Mail"&gt;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/television/shaun-majumder-every-word-really-is-absolutely-true/article4103556/&lt;/ref&gt; In his standup acts, he jokes about joining his schoolmates in chanting racist slurs before realizing that he was the victim they were talking about.&lt;ref name="The Globe and Mail"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Star 2014"&gt;https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/television/2014/12/05/shaun_majumder_celebrates_this_hour_has_22_minutes.html/&lt;/ref&gt; 
Majumder was very close to his mother who he says raised them selflessly so that he and his sister were unaware of the extreme poverty in which they lived.&lt;ref name="The Star 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Winnipeg Free Press"&gt;http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/entertainment/TV/majumder-surprisingly-frank----and-funny----in-hbo-special-149345015.html&lt;/ref&gt; His mother died of a heart attack in 2003.&lt;ref name="Guelph Mercury"&gt;http://www.guelphmercury.com/whatson-story/2783015-comedian-shaun-majumder-shows-emotional-side-in-new-hbo-documentary/&lt;/ref&gt; 
Majumder feels a debt of love to Newfoundland which has influenced him and his work, and has given him a rhythm of appreciation for what he has.&lt;ref name="Progress Media"/&gt;

==Career==
He started his entertainment career as an announcer for the [[YTV (Canadian television)|YTV]] game show ''CLIPS'', and soon was hosting the network's popular morning kids show ''Brain Wash'', where he was known as Ed Brainbin.  He also hosted the "Slime Tour" segments on the popular game show ''[[Uh Oh! (game show)|Uh Oh!]]''. Eventually he joined ''[[This Hour Has 22 Minutes]]'' in 2003, and also hosted 15 episodes of the ''[[Just for Laughs]]'' specials on television and participated in the Comedy festivals in [[Montreal]]. He was also a star of ''[[Cedric the Entertainer Presents]]'', aired in the [[United States]] on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network, and appeared in an NFB documentary on aspiring Canadian comics, ''The Next Big Thing''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfb.ca/trouverunfilm/fichefilm.php?id=51153&amp;v=h&amp;lg=en&amp;exp=${the}%20AND%20${next}%20AND%20${big}%20AND%20${thing} NFB - Collection - The Next Big Thing - DVD&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Majumder has also starred in the [[CBC Television|CBC]] comedy [[Television pilot|pilot]] ''[[Hatching, Matching and Dispatching]]'' and the short film ''Plain Brown Rapper,'' as well as playing Kumar's brother in the 2004 comedy ''[[Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle]]''.

Majumder often plays an [[alter ego]] called Raj Binder. Binder is an awkward, nervous and usually excessively sweaty [[India]]n reporter with a strong [[Accent (dialect)|accent]]. Binder first appeared in a sketch from a comedy showcase with some former YTV costars called ''The Bobroom'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bobroom (TV Movie 2000)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0290476/|website=IMDb|accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also appeared on ''Just For Laughs'' and ''This Hour Has 22 Minutes''. Majumder caused some minor controversy when "Raj" posed in the MegaStars group picture during the [[2003 Heritage Classic]] [[NHL]] outdoor ice-hockey game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comic Dressed As Soccer Player Sneaks Onto Field Before Manchester City Game|url=http://www.cbc.ca/strombo/news/comedian-sneaks-onto-pitch-before-manchester-city-game.html|website=George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight|publisher=CBC|accessdate=8 December 2016|date=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=22 Minutes at 22 Years: I Had No Idea I Shouldn’t Have Done That|url=http://www.cbc.ca/22minutes/videos/clips-season-22/22-minutes-at-22-years-i-had-no-idea-i-shouldnt-have-done-that|publisher=CBC/Radio-Canada|accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Majumder made a guest appearance on two episodes of the television series ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', playing Hasan Numair. He also played Dr. Freddy Sahgal in the short-lived [[Fox TV]] series ''[[Unhitched]]'', which aired in March 2008.

In 2010, he had a guest starring role as Benny Natchie in ''[[Republic of Doyle]]'', and from 2010 to 2011 starred in the American TV series ''[[Detroit 1-8-7]]'' as Detective Vikram Mahajan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abc.go.com/shows/detroit-1-8-7/bio/det-vikram-mahajan/542186 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121070108/http://abc.go.com/shows/detroit-1-8-7/bio/det-vikram-mahajan/542186 |archivedate=2010-11-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2011 Majumder was cast in ''[[The Firm (2012 TV series)|The Firm]]'', a Canadian-American co-production, in the recurring role of Andrew Palmer, the lawyer at the firm who befriends [[Josh Lucas]]' character [[Mitch McDeere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daemonstv.com/2011/08/19/battlestar-galactica-babe-tricia-helfer-to-appear-in-the-firm/|title=Battlestar Galactica Babe Tricia Helfer to Appear in THE FIRM|accessdate=23 August 2011|date=19 August 2011|publisher=DaemonsTV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/firm-battlestar-galactica-detroit-187-225870|title='The Firm': 'Battlestar Galactica,' 'Detroit 187' Duo to Recur: Tricia Helfer and Shaun Majumder join the NBC adaptation of the 1993 feature film. |accessdate=23 August 2011|date=22 August 2011|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|author=Goldberg, Lesley}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show ran for one season.

From 2013 to 2014, Majumder starred in the documentary TV series ''Majumder Manor'', which documented his quest to develop the tourism potential in his picturesque hometown of Burlington, Newfoundland. The show also featured his family, friends, and community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Majumder Manor (TV Series 2013–)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1954647/|website=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, Majumder starred in a controversial satirical short produced by ''This Hour Has 22 Minutes'', titled "Beige Power", which called for [[White supremacy|white supremacists]] to "embrace the beige" and accept that [[human]]s will all "look the same by the year 3000". The short received criticism from the [[alt-right]] community for being racist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Warmington|first1=Joe|title=Seeing red over 'Beige Power' rap parody|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2016/12/06/seeing-red-over-beige-power-rap-parody|accessdate=15 December 2016|publisher=The Toronto Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

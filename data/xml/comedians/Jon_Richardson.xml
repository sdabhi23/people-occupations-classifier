'''Jon Joel Richardson''' (born 26 September 1982)&lt;ref name="Last"&gt;{{cite web |title=Jon Richardson |url=http://www.last.fm/music/Jon+Richardson |website=Last FM |accessdate=24 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is an English comedian. He is known for his appearances on ''[[8 Out of 10 Cats]]'' and ''[[8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown]]'' and his work as co-host with [[Russell Howard]] on [[BBC Radio 6 Music|BBC 6 Music]].

==Early life and career==
Richardson was born and raised in [[Lancaster, Lancashire]], and attended Ryelands Primary School and [[Lancaster Royal Grammar School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thevisitor.co.uk/news/local/night-of-laughs-for-hospice-appeal-1-5834807 |title=Night of laughs for hospice appeal |website=The Visitor |date=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left the [[University of Bristol]] after taking Hispanic Studies for a year and a half, and subsequently spent some time working as a chef.&lt;ref name=2UT /&gt; He then decided to pursue a career in comedy, and lived with fellow comedians [[Russell Howard]], [[Mark Olver (comedian)|Mark Olver]] and [[John Robins (comedian)|John Robins]] for a year in [[Bristol]].&lt;ref name="littlebitocd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/jon-richardson-a-little-bit-ocd |title=A Little Bit OCD |website=Channel 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richardson entered and won his heat of the [[BBC]] New Talent Comedy Search in May 2003. He also reached the semi-finals of the Laughing Horse New Act of the Year competition in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Alex |last=Petty |url=http://www.laughinghorsecomedy.co.uk/newactcomp/pastyears.htm |title=Laughing Horse New Act of the Year |website=Laughinghorsecomedy.co.uk |date= |accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quickly developing throughout 2004, he was one of six acts to reach the final of the [[J2O]] Last Laugh Comedy Search. Having impressed a sell-out crowd in [[Bristol]], he marked the end of his first year in comedy with a performance at the [[Criterion Theatre]] in London's [[West End of London|West End]]. Judges [[Jasper Carrott]] and [[Dave Spikey]] were both "extremely impressed" with Richardson's performance.

In 2006, Richardson appeared in ''The Comedy Zone'' at the [[Edinburgh Festival]]. He also completed a 60-date British and Irish tour with [[Alan Carr]], and made an appearance on Paramount's ''The Comedy Store''. In 2007, ''Spatula Pad'' (Richardson's first solo show at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe) earned him a Best Newcomer nomination at the [[Edinburgh Comedy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comedyawards.co.uk/best-newcomer |title=Best Newcomer 2009 |website=Edinburgh Comedy Awards |date= |accessdate=8 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richardson won the 2008 [[Chortle Awards|Chortle Award]] for Best Breakthrough Act,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/features_static/awards/chortle.php |title=The UK Comedy Guide |website=Chortle |date= |accessdate=8 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and performed ''Dogmatic'' (his second solo show) at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. He later took this show around the country in his first solo tour. He appeared as a team captain in [[Simon Mayo]]'s 2008 series ''Act Your Age'' on [[BBC Radio 4]].

Richardson co-hosted a Sunday morning radio show on [[BBC Radio 6 Music|BBC 6 Music]] with fellow comedian and friend [[Russell Howard]], and after Howard left, he continued to present the show himself until 7 March 2010.

In early 2009, Richardson's show ''This Guy at Night'' was nominated for the Edinburgh Comedy Awards main prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comedyawards.co.uk/2009_shortlist.asp |title=2009 Shortlist |website=Edinburgh Comedy Awards |date=29 August 2009 |accessdate=8 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918201350/http://www.comedyawards.co.uk/2009_shortlist.asp |archivedate=18 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, he appeared on the [[BBC]] music quiz show ''[[Never Mind the Buzzcocks]]''. He also appeared on ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'' in December 2009 and October 2010, and was a guest on [[David Mitchell (comedian)|David Mitchell]]'s ''[[The Bubble (game show)|The Bubble]]''.

Richardson appeared on the [[BBC Radio 5 Live]] show ''[[Fighting Talk]]'' in February 2010. He was curator of ''[[The Museum of Curiosity]]'' for its third series. On 21 March 2010, he presented a [[BBC Three]] programme about compulsions and strange habits, entitled ''Different Like Me''. Richardson has performed at comedy festivals in [[Leeds]], [[Guildford]] and [[Bristol]], and has headlined university gigs for Off the Kerb and Avalon. He has also [[master of ceremonies|compèred]] in the [[French Alps]], headlined in [[Barcelona]], and performed a one-man show in [[Greece]]. In 2010 he also performed at the [[Melbourne Comedy Festival]].&lt;ref name=2UT&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.2uptop.com/news/The-Jon-Richardson-Interview/ |title=The Jon Richardson Interview |website=2-UpTop |date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting with the 11th series of [[Channel 4]]'s panel show ''[[8 Out of 10 Cats]]'', Richardson took over from [[Jason Manford]] as a team captain. Filming for the series began in June 2011. ''[[It's Not Me, It's You!]]'', Richardson's first book, was published during the same month. Later in 2011, he became a regular comic on the Channel 4 show ''[[Stand Up for the Week]]'', which was hosted by [[Kevin Bridges]] during its second series. Upon Bridges's departure, Richardson took over as host, a role he left after series 4 in 2012. Since January 2012, he has also been a regular on Channel 4's ''[[8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown]]'', where it was revealed that he is unable to count to 100 in 30 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;Channel 4, ''8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown'', 29 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Richardson presented a 2012 documentary entitled ''A Little Bit OCD'', in which he studied the lives of people diagnosed with [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|OCD]] and worried that he might have the same condition; he was indeed revealed to exhibit symptoms of OCD, but did not show signs of the accompanying dysfunction. The show won the 2013 Mind Award in the documentary category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mind.org.uk/news-campaigns/news/scott-mills-announces-winners-at-20th-mind-media-awards,-sponsored-by-virgin-money-giving/ |title=Scott Mills announces winners at 20th Mind Media Awards, sponsored by Virgin Money Giving |website=[[Mind (charity)|Mind]] |date=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 November 2012, Richardson released his first stand up DVD, ''Funny Magnet''. The performance was recorded at the [[Apollo Theatre]] in Hammersmith on 9 September 2012. The DVD also features Richardson's set from ''[[Live at the Apollo (TV series)|Live at the Apollo]]'' and audio commentary with his housemate, comedian [[Matt Forde]].

In December 2012, Channel 4 broadcast ''The Real Man's Road Trip: Sean &amp; Jon Go West'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-real-mans-road-trip-sean-jon-go-west |title=The Real Man's Road Trip – Sean and Jon Go West |website=Channel 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; a two-part series in which Richardson and his ''8 Out of 10 Cats'' colleague [[Sean Lock]] travelled to [[Louisiana]] to experience the local culture and lifestyle. The show was filmed in September 2012.

Richardson began Work in Progress shows in late 2013, and in 2014 took his new show ''Nidiot'' on the road culminating in a DVD of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jonrichardsoncomedy.com/2014/12/01/nidiot-dvd-available-now/ |title=Nidiot DVD available now |website=jonrichardsoncomedy.com |date=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2013 he headlined the comedy stage at the [[V Festival]].

Appearing on Radio 5's ''Fighting Talk'' on 11 January 2014, Richardson said his worst ever gig was a couple of months previously at [[The Dome Leisure Centre|Doncaster Dome]]. He claimed the initial smattering of applause quickly reduced through his time on stage.&lt;ref&gt;BBC Radio 5, ''Fighting Talk'', 11 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Richardson lived in [[Swindon]] for five years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gigglebeats.co.uk/2012/11/jon-richardson-nothing-i-say-deserves-repeating-in-posterity/ |title=Jon Richardson: "Nothing I say deserves repeating in posterity" |website=Giggle Beats|first=Peter |last=Dixon|date=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; then in [[Surbiton]], [[Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames|Kingston upon Thames]], London, with fellow comedians [[Matt Forde]] and Danny Buckler. He also lived with comedians John Robins and Russell Howard &lt;ref name="littlebitocd" /&gt; In a 2012 interview with ''Woman'' magazine, he mentioned he had bought a house in the [[Lake District]] for his mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152278449810562&amp;set=o.2260900000&amp;type=3&amp;theater |title=Jon Richardson Appreciation Society |website=Facebook |date=24 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a vegetarian,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.natgeotraveller.co.uk/smart-travel/features/the-funny-man-jon-richardson/|title=Interview: Jon Richardson {{!}} National Geographic Traveller (UK)|website=www.natgeotraveller.co.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a football fan and supporter of [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]].

Richardson married comedian [[Lucy Beaumont (comedian)|Lucy Beaumont]] in April 2015 after dating for about two years. Their first child, a daughter named Elsie, was born in September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/sep/13/jon-richardson-grows-up-ocd |title=Jon Richardson: 'I didn't have any sex, I didn't do any drugs' |first=James |last=Kettle |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://podbay.fm/show/821623813/e/1429965395 |title=Elis James and John Robins XFM Podcast, Episode 63 |date=25 April 2015 |website=XFM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richardson has [[obsessive compulsive personality disorder]], which was the subject of his [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] show ''Spatula Pad''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thevisitor.co.uk/news/jon-richardson-returns-to-morecambe-winter-gardens-for-lancaster-hospice-1-7966005 |title=Jon Richardson returns to Morecambe Winter Gardens for Lancaster hospice|first=Gemma |last=Sherlock |newspaper=[[The Visitor (newspaper)|The Visitor]] |date=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jonrichardsoncomedy.com/bio/|title=Bio-Jon Richardson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

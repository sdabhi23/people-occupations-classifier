'''Heywood "Woody" Allen''' &lt;!--We always list the subject's legal name first before any other names they might have had. Birth names are usually included adjacent. If a subject has had more than one name, a note citation is added. i.e. John Wayne (Refer to: Wikipedia:Naming conventions (people)). --&gt; (born '''Allan Stewart Konigsberg'''; December 1, 1935) is an American director, writer, actor, and comedian whose career spans more than six decades. He began his career as a comedy writer in the 1950s, writing jokes and scripts for television and publishing several books of short humor pieces. In the early 1960s, Allen began performing as a stand-up comedian, emphasizing [[monologue]]s rather than traditional jokes. As a comedian, he developed the persona of an insecure, intellectual, fretful [[wikt:nebbish|nebbish]], which he maintains is quite different from his real-life personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=Terry Gross|last=Gross|first= Terry|date=January 27, 2012|url= https://www.npr.org/2012/01/27/145760095/woody-allen-blending-real-life-with-fiction |title=Woody Allen: Blending Real Life With Fiction|work=[[Fresh Air]]|accessdate=April 7, 2012|archivedate= September 11, 2012| archiveurl=

By the mid-1960s, Allen was writing and directing films, first specializing in [[slapstick]] comedies before moving into dramatic material influenced by [[European art cinema]] during the 1970s, and alternating between comedies and dramas to the present. He is often identified as part of the [[New Hollywood]] wave of filmmakers of the mid-1960s to late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jan/13/woody-allen-michael-newton |title=Woody Allen: cinema's great experimentalist |last=Newton|first= Michael |date=January 13, 2012 |work=The Guardian|location=London|accessdate=April 9, 2012|archivedate=January 19, 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20180119152036/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jan/13/woody-allen-michael-newton|deadurl=no |quote=In the 1970s, Allen looked irreverent, hip, a part of the New Hollywood generation.

Allen has received many [[List of awards and nominations received by Woody Allen|accolades and honors]] throughout his career. He has won four [[Academy Awards]]: three for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] and one for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]].

For pay, he wrote jokes (or "gags") for agent David O. Alber, who sold them to newspaper columnists. At the age of 17, he legally changed his name to Heywood Allen&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{Britannica|16217}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later began to call himself Woody Allen.

== Career ==

=== Comedy writer ===
Allen began writing short jokes when he was 15,&lt;ref name=Kelley /&gt; and the following year began sending them to various Broadway writers to see if they'd be interested in buying any. He also began going by the name "Woody Allen".&lt;ref name=Nachman /&gt;{{rp|539}} One of those writers was [[Abe Burrows]], coauthor of ''[[Guys and Dolls]]'', who wrote, "Wow! His stuff was dazzling." Burrows then wrote Allen letters of introduction to [[Sid Caesar]], [[Phil Silvers]], and [[Peter Lind Hayes]], who immediately sent Allen a check for just the jokes Burrows included as samples.&lt;ref name=Nachman /&gt;{{rp|541}}

As a result of the jokes Allen mailed to various writers, he was invited, then age 19, to join the NBC Writer's Development Program in 1955, followed by a job on ''The NBC Comedy Hour'' in Los Angeles. He was later hired as a full-time writer for humorist [[Herb Shriner]], initially earning $25 a week.&lt;ref name="timemag" /&gt; He began writing scripts for ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', ''[[Tonight Starring Steve Allen|The Tonight Show]]'', specials for Sid Caesar post-''[[Caesar's Hour]]'' (1954–1957), and other television shows.&lt;ref name="Lax Bio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="imdbprofile"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000095/+IMDb+profile |title=IMDb: Woody Allen |accessdate=January 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sup|p.111}} By the time he was working for Caesar, he was earning $1,500 a week; with Caesar, he worked alongside [[Danny Simon]], whom Allen credits for helping form his writing style.&lt;ref name="timemag" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/27/AR2005072702568_pf.html |title=TV Comedy Writer Danny Simon Dies |work=[[The Washington Post]] |first=Adam |last=Bernstein |accessdate=January 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962 alone he estimated that he wrote twenty thousand jokes for various comics.&lt;ref name=Nachman /&gt;{{rp|533}}

Allen also wrote for the  ''[[Candid Camera]]'' television show, and appeared in some episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=February 15, 2009 |url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYpROqeKRMY| title=Woody Allen Candid Camera Must See| publisher=YouTube| accessdate=November 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=February 17, 1987| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/17/arts/tv-reviews-candid-camera-marks-40-years-with-a-special.html?src=pm| title=TV Reviews; 'Candid Camera' Marks 40 Years With a Special| work = [[The New York Times]] | accessdate=November 5, 2011| first=John J.| last=O'Connor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000095/| title=Woody Allen – IMDb| accessdate=November 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with that show, he wrote jokes for the [[Buddy Hackett]] sitcom ''Stanley'' and ''[[Pat Boone|The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom]]''. And in 1958 he co-wrote a few Sid Caesar specials with [[Larry Gelbart]].&lt;ref name=Nachman /&gt;{{rp|542}} After writing for many of television's leading comedians and comedy shows, Allen was gaining the reputation for being a "genius", says composer [[Mary Rodgers]]. When given an assignment for a show he would leave and come back the next day with "reams of paper", according to producer [[Max Liebman]].&lt;ref name=Nachman /&gt;{{rp|542}} Similarly, after writing for [[Bob Hope]], Hope called him "half a genius".&lt;ref name=Nachman /&gt;{{rp|542}}

His daily writing routine could go as long as fifteen hours, and he could focus and write anywhere necessary. [[Dick Cavett]] was amazed at Allen's capacity to write: "He can go to a typewriter after breakfast and sit there until the sun sets and his head is pounding, interrupting work only for coffee and a brief walk, and then spend the whole evening working."&lt;ref name=Nachman /&gt;{{rp|551}} When Allen wrote for other comedians, they would use eight out of ten of his jokes. When he began performing as a stand-up, he was much more selective, typically using only one out of ten jokes. He estimated that to prepare for a 30-minute show, he spent six months of intensive writing.&lt;ref name=Nachman /&gt;{{rp|551}} He enjoyed writing, however, despite the work: "Nothing makes me happier than to tear open a ream of paper. And I can't wait to fill it! I love to do it."&lt;ref name=Nachman /&gt;{{rp|551}}

Allen started writing short stories and cartoon captions for magazines such as ''[[The New Yorker]]''; he was inspired by the tradition of  ''New Yorker'' humorists [[S. J. Perelman]], [[George S.

=== Stand-up comedian ===
[[File:Woody Allen - Kup.JPG|thumb|Allen in the 1960s]]
From 1960 to 1969, Allen performed as a [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]] to supplement his comedy writing. His contemporaries during those years included [[Lenny Bruce]], [[Shelley Berman]], the team of [[Mike Nichols]] and [[Elaine May]], and [[Mort Sahl]], his personal favorite. Comedy historian [[Gerald Nachman (journalist)|Gerald Nachman]] notes that Allen, while not the first to do stand-up, would eventually have greater impact than all the others in the 1960s, and would redefine the meaning of stand-up comedy: "He helped turn it into biting, brutally honest satirical commentary on the cultural and psychological tenor of the times."&lt;ref name=Nachman&gt;{{cite book |last1= Nachman |first1=Gerald |author-link1= Gerald Nachman (journalist) |title=Seriously Funny |script-title=The Rebel Comedians of the 1950s and 1960s|url=http://geraldnachman.com/about.html |location=New York, NY |publisher=Pantheon Books |publication-date=2003 |page=659 |isbn=  978-0-375-41030-7 &lt;!-- 0375410309 --&gt; |oclc=50339527 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|525}}

After Allen was taken under the wing of his new manager, [[Jack Rollins (producer)|Jack Rollins]], who had recently discovered Nichols and May, Rollins suggested he perform his written jokes as a stand-up. Allen was resistant at first, but after seeing [[Mort Sahl]] on stage, he felt safer to give it a try: "I'd never had the nerve to talk about it before. Then Mort Sahl came along with a whole new style of humor, opening up vistas for people like me."&lt;ref name=Nachman /&gt;{{rp|545}} Allen made his professional stage debut at the Blue Angel nightclub in Manhattan in October 1960, where comedian [[Shelley Berman]] introduced him as a young television writer who would perform his own material.&lt;ref name=Nachman /&gt;{{rp|545}}

His early stand-up shows with his different style of humor were not always well received or understood by his audiences. Unlike other comedians, Allen spoke to his audiences in a gentle and conversational style, often appearing to be searching for words, although his style was well rehearsed. He acted "normal", dressed casually, and made no attempt to project a stage "personality". And he did not improvise: "I put very little premium on improvisation," he told [[Studs Terkel]].&lt;ref name=Nachman /&gt;{{rp|532}} His jokes were created from life experiences, and typically presented with a dead serious demeanor which made them funnier: "I don't think my family liked me. They put a live teddy bear in my crib."&lt;ref name=Nachman /&gt;{{rp|533}}

The subjects of his jokes were rarely topical, political or socially relevant. Unlike Bruce and Sahl, he did not discuss current events such as civil rights, women's rights, the Cold War, or Vietnam. And although he was described as a "classic nebbish", he did not tell Jewish jokes. Comedy screenwriter [[Larry Gelbart]] compared Allen's style to [[Elaine May]]: "He just styled himself completely after her," he said.&lt;ref name=Nachman /&gt;{{rp|546}} Like [[Nichols and May]], he often made fun of intellectuals.

Television talk show host [[Dick Cavett]], who was among the minority who quickly appreciated Allen's unique style, recalls seeing the audience at the Blue Angel mostly ignore Allen's [[monologue]]: "I recognized immediately that there was no young comedian in the country in the same class with him for sheer brilliance of jokes, and I resented the fact that the audience was too dumb to realize what they were getting."&lt;ref name=Nachman /&gt;{{rp|550}} It was his subdued stage presence, while initially unappreciated, that eventually became one of Allen's strongest traits, explains Nachman: "The utter absence of showbiz veneer and shtick was the best shtick any comedian had ever devised. This uneasy onstage naturalness became a trademark."&lt;ref name=Nachman /&gt;{{rp|530}} When he was finally noticed by the media, writers like ''New York Times''{{'}} [[Arthur Gelb]] would describe Allen's nebbish quality as being [[Charlie Chaplin|"Chaplinesque"]] and "refreshing".

Allen developed an [[Anxiety|anxious]], nervous, and intellectual persona for his stand-up act, a successful move that secured regular gigs for him in nightclubs and on television. Allen brought innovation to the comedy monologue genre and his stand-up comedy would be considered influential.&lt;ref name="LuttazziScanzi2002"&gt;{{cite journal| title=''Man on the moon'', interview with comedian [[Daniele Luttazzi]] | first=Andrea |last= Scanzi | publisher= Il Mucchio Selvaggio | year= 2002 | language= Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen first appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' on November 1, 1963 and over nine years his guest appearances included seventeen in the host’s chair. He subsequently released three LP albums of live nightclub recordings: the self-titled ''[[Woody Allen (album)|Woody Allen]]'' (1964), ''Volume 2'' (1965), and ''The Third Woody Allen Album'' (1968) recorded at a fund-raiser for Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]]'s presidential run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pophistorydig.com/topics/1968-presidential-race-democrats/|title=1968 Presidential RaceDemocrats {{!}} The Pop History Dig|website=www.pophistorydig.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Allen had his own TV special in Great Britain called ''The Woody Allen Show.''  In 1967 he hosted an episode of ''The [[Kraft Music Hall]]'' where he would intersperse humor with interviews of famous people, including conservative writer [[William F. Buckley]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=194zJ55LcVk Billy Graham on Woody Allen Show, 1967], 2-part video, 10 min.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969 he hosted his first American special for [[CBS]] television which included a humorous spot with The [[Rev.

=== Playwright ===
[[File:Woody Allen - Sam.JPG|thumb|left|Allen with the Broadway cast of ''Play It Again, Sam'' (1969).]]
In 1966, Allen wrote the play ''[[Don't Drink the Water (play)|Don't Drink the Water]]''. The play starred [[Lou Jacobi]], [[Kay Medford]], [[Anita Gillette]] and Allen's future movie co-star [[Tony Roberts (actor)|Tony Roberts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Don't Drink the Water – Broadway Play – Original|url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/don't-drink-the-water-3347|publisher=[[Internet Broadway Database]]|accessdate=July 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Don't Drink the Water (1969 film)|film adaptation of the play]], directed by Howard Morris, was released in 1969, starring [[Jackie Gleason]]. Because he was not particularly happy with the 1969 film version of his play, in 1994, Allen directed and starred in a [[Don't Drink the Water (1994 film)|second version]] for television, with [[Michael J. Fox]] and [[Mayim Bialik]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Made-for-TV Woody |work=New York |first=John|last=Leonard|authorlink=John Leonard (critic)|page=92|date=December 12, 1994 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M-QCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA92#v=onepage&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next play Allen wrote for Broadway was ''[[Play It Again, Sam (play)|Play It Again, Sam]]'', in which he also starred. The play opened on February 12, 1969, and ran for 453 performances. It featured [[Diane Keaton]] and Roberts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Play It Again, Sam – Broadway Play – Original|url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/play-it-again-sam-2849|publisher=[[Internet Broadway Database]]|accessdate=July 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play was significant to Keaton's budding career, and she has stated she was in "awe" of Allen even before auditioning for her role, which was the first time she met him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keaton|first1=Diane|title=Diane Keaton: The Big Picture|url=http://www.vogue.com/865402/diane-keaton-the-big-picture/#1|website=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]|accessdate=July 18, 2016|date=October 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During an interview in 2013, Keaton stated that she "fell in love with him right away," adding, "I wanted to be his girlfriend so I did something about it."&lt;ref name=Keaton&gt;[http://www.netquake.net/2013/06/actress-diane-keaton-talks-about-woody-allen-her-career-and-personal-life/ "Actress Diane Keaton Talks About Woody Allen, Her Career and Personal Life"], ''Netquake'', June 2, 2013 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821202143/http://www.netquake.net/2013/06/actress-diane-keaton-talks-about-woody-allen-her-career-and-personal-life/ |date=August 21, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After co-starring alongside Allen in the subsequent [[Play It Again, Sam (film)|film version of ''Play It Again, Sam'']], she would later co-star in ''Sleeper'', ''Love and Death'', ''Interiors'', ''Manhattan'' and ''Annie Hall''. "He showed me the ropes and I followed his lead. He is the most disciplined person I know. He works very hard," Keaton has stated.&lt;ref name=Keaton /&gt; "I find the same thing sexy in a man now as I always have: humor. I love it when they are funny. It's to die for."&lt;ref name=IMDB /&gt;

For its March 21, 1969, issue, ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' featured Allen on its cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2neatmagazines.com/life/1969cover.html |title=1969 LIFE Magazine Cover Art |accessdate=January 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, his play ''[[The Floating Light Bulb]]'' premiered on Broadway and ran for 65 performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Floating Light Bulb – Broadway Play – Original|url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/the-floating-light-bulb-4112|publisher=[[Internet Broadway Database]]|accessdate=July 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While receiving mixed reviews, it gave an autobiographical insight into Allen's childhood, specifically his fascination with magic tricks. He has written several one-act plays, including ''Riverside Drive'' and ''Old Saybrook'' exploring well-known Allen themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rich|first1=Frank|title=Stage: 'Light Bulb', By Woody Allen|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/28/theater/stage-light-bulb-by-woody-allen.html?pagewanted=|website=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=July 18, 2016|date=April 28, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sullivan|first1=Dan|title=Stage Review : Few Laughs In Allen's 'Light Bulb'|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-01-12/entertainment/ca-3041_1_light-bulb|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=July 18, 2016|date=January 12, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 20, 2011, Allen's one-act play ''Honeymoon Motel'' opened as part of a larger piece entitled ''[[Relatively Speaking (2011 play)|Relatively Speaking]]'' on Broadway, with two other one-act plays, one by [[Coen Brothers|Ethan Coen]] and one by [[Elaine May]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/21/theater/reviews/relatively-speaking-at-brooks-atkinson-theater-review.html "Each Family, Tortured in Its Own Way"] by [[Charles Isherwood]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early films ===
His first movie was the [[Charles K. Feldman]] production ''[[What's New Pussycat?]]'' in 1965, for which he wrote the screenplay.&lt;ref name="PBSdocumentary"&gt;{{cite video |people=Weide, Robert B. (Director) |title=Woody Allen: A Documentary |url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/woody-allen-a-documentary/about-the-film/1865/ |medium=Television |publisher=[[PBS]], November 21, 2011 |accessdate=July 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was disappointed with the final product, which inspired him to direct every film that he would later write.&lt;ref name="PBSdocumentary" /&gt; Allen's first directorial effort was ''[[What's Up, Tiger Lily?]]'' (1966, co-written with Mickey Rose), in which an existing Japanese spy movie—''[[Kokusai himitsu keisatsu: Kagi no kagi]]'' (1965), "International Secret Police: Key of Keys"—was redubbed in English by Allen and friends with fresh new, comic dialogue. In 1967, Allen played Jimmy Bond in the 007 spoof ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]''.

Allen directed, starred in, and co-wrote (with Mickey Rose) ''[[Take the Money and Run]]'' in 1969, which received positive reviews. He later signed a deal with [[United Artists]] to produce several films. Those films eventually became ''[[Bananas (film)|Bananas]]'' (1971, co-written with Rose), ''[[Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) (film)|Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex*]]'' (1972), ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'' (1973), and ''[[Love and Death]]'' (1975).&lt;ref name="PBSdocumentary" /&gt; ''Sleeper'' was the first of four screenplays co-written by Allen and [[Marshall Brickman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/04/annie-hall-40th-anniversary-woody-allen-carol-kane-marshall-brickman|title=The Annie Hall That Might Have Been: Inside Woody Allen’s Anhedonia|last=Liebenson|first=Donald|work=HWD|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LvbdCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=work+co-written+by+Allen+and+Marshall+Brickman.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yv818v8ROl&amp;sig=LMBCiToGi3OhghsLb3ca12lR3oE&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiU54TgwsbZAhUGlxQKHd5rDBcQ6AEISTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=work%20co-written%20by%20Allen%20and%20Marshall%20Brickman.&amp;f=false|title=Script Partners: How to Succeed at Co-Writing for Film &amp; TV|last=Stevens|first=Matt|last2=Johnson|first2=Claudia|date=2016-03-31|publisher=CRC Press|year=|isbn=9781317417927|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Allen wrote and starred in the film version of ''[[Play It Again, Sam (film)|Play It Again, Sam]]'', directed by [[Herbert Ross]] and co-starring Diane Keaton. In 1976, he starred as cashier Howard Prince, in ''[[The Front]],'' directed by [[Martin Ritt]]. ''The Front'' was a humorous and poignant account of Hollywood [[blacklist]]ing during the 1950s; Ritt, screenwriter [[Walter Bernstein]], and three of Allen's cast-mates, [[Zero Mostel|Samuel "Zero" Mostel]], [[Herschel Bernardi]], and [[Lloyd Gough]], had themselves been blacklisted.

''Rolling Stone'', "A Conversation with the Real Woody Allen", July 1, 1976 pp. 34-40&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Then came two of Allen's most popular films. ''[[Annie Hall]]'' won four [[Academy Awards]] in 1977, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress in a Leading Role]] for [[Diane Keaton]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Woody Allen. ''Annie Hall'' set the standard for modern romantic comedy and ignited a fashion trend with the clothes worn by Diane Keaton in the film. In an interview with journalist [[Katie Couric]], Keaton does not deny that Allen wrote the part for her and about her.&lt;ref name=Couric&gt;{{YouTube|blGicJHQZdo|"Annie Hall Interview with Diane Keaton by Katie Couric"}}, video interview, 2 min.&lt;/ref&gt; She also explains that Allen wrote the part based on aspects of her personality at the time:

{{quote|Of course I recognized myself in the roles [Woody Allen] wrote. I mean, in ''Annie Hall'' (1977) particularly. I was this sort of novice who had lots of feelings but didn't know how to express herself, and I see that in Annie. I think Woody used a kind of essential quality that he found in me at that time, and I'm glad he did because it worked really well in the movie.&lt;ref name=IMDB&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000473/bio#quotes Personal quotes by Diane Keaton], Internet Movie Database&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The film is ranked at No. 35 on the ''[[American Film Institute]]''{{'s}} "100 Best Movies" and at No. 4 on the AFI list of "100 Best Comedies."

''[[Manhattan (film)|Manhattan]]'' (1979), is a black-and-white film often viewed as an homage to New York City. As in many Allen films, the main protagonists are upper-middle class writers and academics. The love{{endash}}hate opinion of cerebral persons found in ''Manhattan'' is characteristic of many of Allen's movies, including ''[[Crimes and Misdemeanors]]'' and ''Annie Hall.'' ''Manhattan'' focuses on the complicated relationship between middle-aged Isaac Davis (Allen) with 17-year-old Tracy ([[Mariel Hemingway]]), and co-stars Diane Keaton.

Keaton, who made eight movies with Allen during her career, tries to explain why his films are unique:
{{quote|He just has a mind like nobody else. He's bold. He's got a lot of strength, a lot of courage in terms of his work. And that is what it takes to do something really unique. Along with a genius imagination.&lt;ref name=Couric /&gt;}}

Between ''Annie Hall'' and ''Manhattan'', Allen wrote and directed the dark drama ''[[Interiors]]'' (1978),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Interiors|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/interiors/|language=en|accessdate=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the style of [[Swedish people|Swedish]] director [[Ingmar Bergman]], one of Allen's chief influences. ''Interiors'' represented a departure from Allen's "early, funny" comedies (a line from 1980's ''[[Stardust Memories]]'').

=== 1980s ===
Allen's 1980s films, even the comedies, have somber and philosophical undertones, with their influences being the works of European directors, specifically [[Ingmar Bergman]] and [[Federico Fellini]]. ''[[Stardust Memories]]'' was based on ''[[8½]]'', which it parodies, and ''[[Wild Strawberries (film)|Wild Strawberries]]''. ''[[A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy]]'' was adapted from ''[[Smiles of a Summer Night]]''. In ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'', part of the film's structure and background is borrowed from ''[[Fanny and Alexander]]''. ''[[Amarcord]]'' inspired ''[[Radio Days]]''. ''[[September (1987 film)|September]]'' resembles ''[[Autumn Sonata]]''. Allen uses many elements from ''Wild Strawberries''. In ''[[Crimes and Misdemeanors]]'', Allen references a scene from ''Wild Strawberries''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wilmington|first1=Michael|title=rectors (Page 2 of 2) COMMENTARY : Woody Allen Keeps the Faith : 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' tears down the wall between his serious and comic sides (Page 2)|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-10-22/entertainment/ca-984_1_woody-allen-movie/2|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=April 13, 2016|date=October 22, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Stardust Memories'' (1980) features Sandy Bates, a successful filmmaker played by Allen, who expresses resentment and scorn for his fans. Overcome by the recent death of a friend from illness, the character states, "I don't want to make funny movies any more" and a running gag has various people (including visiting space aliens) telling Bates that they appreciate his films, "especially the early, funny ones."&lt;ref name="triviana"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://triviana.com/film/sfilm/stmem.htm |title=Stardust Memories review |accessdate=January 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen believes this to be one of his best films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Kamp, David |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/18/books/review/Kamp-t.html |title= Woody Talks |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 18, 2007 |accessdate=March 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen has combined tragic and comic elements in such films as ''Hannah and Her Sisters'' (1986) and ''Crimes and Misdemeanors'' (1989), in which he tells two stories that connect at the end. He also made three films about show business: ''[[Broadway Danny Rose]]'', in which he plays a New York show business agent, ''[[The Purple Rose of Cairo]]'', a movie that shows the importance of the cinema during the Depression through the character of the naive Cecilia, and ''[[Radio Days]]'', a film about his childhood in Brooklyn and the importance of the radio. The film co-starred Farrow in a part Allen wrote specifically for her.&lt;ref name=Allen1 /&gt;

''The Purple Rose of Cairo'' was named by ''Time'' as one of the 100 best films of all time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Corliss|first1=Richard|title=Best Movies of All Time|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2005/02/12/all-time-100-movies/slide/the-purple-rose-of-cairo-1985/|website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=April 13, 2016|date=January 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Allen described it as one of his three best films, along with ''Stardust Memories'' and ''[[Match Point]]''&lt;ref name=premiere-interview&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Allen defines them as "best" not in terms of quality but because they came closest to his vision). In 1989, Allen teamed with directors [[Francis Ford Coppola]] and [[Martin Scorsese]] to make ''[[New York Stories]]'', an [[anthology film]] about New Yorkers. Allen's short, ''[[New York Stories|Oedipus Wrecks]]'', is about a neurotic lawyer and his critical mother. His short pleased critics, but ''New York Stories'' bombed at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=newyorkstories.htm |title=Box Office Information for ''New York Stories'' |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=April 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Canby|first1=Vincent|title=FILM VIEW; Anthologies Can Be A Bargain|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=950DE3DA1038F931A25750C0A96F948260|website=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=April 13, 2016|date=March 12, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1990s ===
His 1991 film ''[[Shadows and Fog]]'' is a black-and-white homage to the [[German Expressionism|German expressionists]] and features the music of [[Kurt Weill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dowd|first1=A.A.|title=Woody does German Expressionism in Shadows And Fog|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/woody-does-german-expressionism-in-ishadows-and-fo-100754|website=[[The A.V. Club]]|accessdate=April 3, 2016|date=July 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen then made his critically acclaimed comedy-drama ''[[Husbands and Wives]]'' (1992), which received two Oscar nominations: Best Supporting Actress for [[Judy Davis]] and Best Original Screenplay for Allen. His film ''[[Manhattan Murder Mystery]]'' (1993) combined suspense with dark comedy and marked the return of [[Diane Keaton]], [[Alan Alda]] and [[Anjelica Huston]].

He returned to lighter movies like ''[[Bullets over Broadway]]'' (1994), which earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Director, followed by a musical, ''[[Everyone Says I Love You]]'' (1996). The singing and dancing scenes in ''Everyone Says I Love You'' are similar to musicals starring [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Ginger Rogers]]. The comedy ''[[Mighty Aphrodite]]'' (1995), in which Greek drama plays a large role, won an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Academy Award]] for [[Mira Sorvino]]. Allen's 1999 jazz-based comedy-drama ''[[Sweet and Lowdown]]'' was nominated for two Academy Awards for [[Sean Penn]] (Best Actor) and [[Samantha Morton]] (Best Supporting Actress). In contrast to these lighter movies, Allen veered into darker satire toward the end of the decade with ''[[Deconstructing Harry]]'' (1997) and ''[[Celebrity (film)|Celebrity]]'' (1998).

During this decade, Allen also starred in the television film ''[[The Sunshine Boys (1996 film)|The Sunshine Boys]]'' (1995), based on the [[Neil Simon]] [[The Sunshine Boys|play of the same name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Evans|first1=Greg|title=Review: ‘The Sunshine Boys’|url=https://variety.com/1997/tv/reviews/the-sunshine-boys-4-1200452126/|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=April 3, 2016|date=December 21, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen made one sitcom "appearance" via telephone on the show ''[[Just Shoot Me!]]'' in a 1997 episode, "My Dinner with Woody", which paid tribute to several of his films. Allen provided the voice of Z in [[DreamWorks]]' first animated film, ''[[Antz]]'' (1998), which featured many actors he had worked with; Allen's character was similar to his earlier neurotic roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clinton|first1=Paul|title=Review: Woody Allen still Woody in 'Antz'|url=http://edition.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Movies/9810/02/review.antz/|publisher=CNN|accessdate=April 3, 2016|date=October 2, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2000s ===
''[[Small Time Crooks]]'' (2000) was Allen's first film with the [[DreamWorks]] studio and represented a change in direction: Allen began giving more interviews and made an attempt to return to his slapstick roots. The film is similar to the 1942 film ''Larceny, Inc.'' (from a play by S.J. Perelman).&lt;ref name=TCM&gt;[[Robert Osborne]] of [[Turner Classic Movies]] on June 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Allen never commented on whether this was deliberate or if his film was in any way inspired by it. ''Small Time Crooks'' was a relative financial success, grossing over $17 million domestically but Allen's next four films foundered at the box office, including Allen's most costly film, ''[[The Curse of the Jade Scorpion]]'' (with a budget of $26 million). ''[[Hollywood Ending]]'', ''[[Anything Else]]'', and ''[[Melinda and Melinda]]'' were given "rotten" ratings from film-review website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and each earned less than $4 million domestically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/p/woody_allen |title=Woody Allen – Rotten Tomatoes Celebrity Profile |accessdate=January 17, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625200602/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/p/woody_allen/ |archivedate=June 25, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics claimed that Allen's early 2000s films were subpar and expressed concern that Allen's best years were behind him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qwipster.net/melindamelinda.htm |title=Melinda and Melinda review (2004) Woody Allen – Qwipster's Movie Reviews |accessdate=January 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others were less harsh; reviewing the little-liked ''Melinda and Melinda'', [[Roger Ebert]] wrote, "I cannot escape the suspicion that if Woody had never made a previous film, if each new one was Woody's Sundance debut, it would get a better reception. His reputation is not a dead shark but an albatross, which with admirable economy Allen has arranged for the critics to carry around their own necks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LtJgv-f-nl8C&amp;pg=PA451&amp;lpg=PA451&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Roger Ebert's Movie Yearbook 2007|publisher=Google Books |date= November 1, 2006|accessdate=January 9, 2011|isbn=978-0-7407-6157-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woody gave his godson Quincy Rose a small part in ''Melinda and Melinda''.

[[File:Woody Allen (2006).jpeg|thumb|left|upright|Allen in 2006]]
Allen was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2001.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=April 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Match Point]]'' (2005) was one of Allen's most successful films of the decade, garnering positive reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/match-point|title=Match Point Reviews|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=December 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Set in London, it starred [[Jonathan Rhys Meyers]] and [[Scarlett Johansson]]. It is markedly darker than Allen's first four films with DreamWorks SKG. In ''Match Point'', Allen shifted focus from the intellectual upper class of New York to the moneyed upper class of London. The film earned more than $23 million domestically (more than any of his films in nearly 20 years) and over $62 million in international box office sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?view=Director&amp;id=woodallen.html |title=Box Office Mojo – People Index |accessdate=January 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Match Point'' earned Allen his first Academy Award nomination since 1998, for Best Writing&amp;nbsp;– Original Screenplay, with directing and writing nominations at the Golden Globes, his first Globe nominations since 1987. In a 2006 interview with ''[[Premiere Magazine]]'', Allen stated this was the best film he has ever made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Matloff|first=Jason|date=February 2006|title=Woody Allen's European Vacation|magazine=[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]|volume=19|issue=5|pages=98–101|quote=I think it turned out to be the best film I've ever made.|url=http://jasonmatloff.com/selected-articles/woody-allens-european-vacation/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303210547/http://jasonmatloff.com/selected-articles/woody-allens-european-vacation/|archivedate=March 3, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen returned to London to film ''[[Scoop (2006 film)|Scoop]]'', which also starred Johansson, [[Hugh Jackman]], [[Ian McShane]], [[Kevin McNally]] and Allen himself. The film was released on July 28, 2006, and received mixed reviews. He filmed ''[[Cassandra's Dream]]'' in London. ''Cassandra's Dream'' was released in November 2007, and stars [[Colin Farrell]], [[Ewan McGregor]] and [[Tom Wilkinson (actor)|Tom Wilkinson]].

After finishing his third London film, Allen headed to Spain. He reached an agreement to film ''[[Vicky Cristina Barcelona]]'' in [[Avilés]], Barcelona and [[Oviedo]], where shooting started on July 9, 2007. The movie stars [[Scarlett Johansson]], [[Javier Bardem]], [[Rebecca Hall]] and [[Penélope Cruz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,249259,00.html |title= Woody Allen's Next Star: Penelope Cruz – Celebrity Gossip |publisher=Fox News Channel |accessdate=January 17, 2008 |date=February 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117935397 |title=Spain woos Woody | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=January 17, 2008 |first=John |last=Hopewell |date=January 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking of his experience there, Allen said: "I'm delighted at being able to work with Mediapro and make a film in Spain, a country which has become so special to me." ''Vicky Cristina Barcelona'' was well received, winning [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy]] at the Golden Globe awards. Penélope Cruz received the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her role in the film.

Allen has said that he "survives" on the European market. Audiences there tend to be more receptive to his films, particularly in Spain, France and Italy—countries where he has a large audience (joked about in ''Hollywood Ending''). "In the United States things have changed a lot, and it's hard to make good small films now," Allen said in a 2004 interview. "The avaricious studios couldn't care less about good films—if they get a good film they're twice as happy but money-making films are their goal. They only want these $100 million pictures that make $500 million."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,6737,1278451,00.html |title=Why I love London |first=Simon |last=Garfield |date= August 8, 2004 |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=January 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Whatever Works'' was originally written by Allen in the 1970s, and the character played by David was written for [[Zero Mostel]], who died the year ''Annie Hall'' came out.

While best known for his films, Allen has enjoyed a successful career in theatre, starting as early as 1960, when he wrote sketches for the revue ''[[From A to Z]]''. His first great success was ''[[Don't Drink the Water (play)|Don't Drink the Water]]'', which opened in 1968, and ran for 598 performances for almost two years on Broadway. His success continued with ''[[Play It Again, Sam (play)|Play It Again, Sam]]'', which opened in 1969, starring Allen and [[Diane Keaton]]. The show played for 453 performances and was nominated for three [[Tony Awards]], although none of the nominations were for Allen's writing or acting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Broadway League |url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=2849 |title=Internet Broadway Database: Play It Again, Sam Production Credits |publisher=Ibdb |date=March 14, 1970 |accessdate=March 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, Allen wrote a number of one-act plays, most notably ''[[God (play)|God]]'' and ''[[Death (play)|Death]]'', which were published in his 1975 collection ''[[Without Feathers]]''. In 1981, Allen's play ''[[The Floating Light Bulb]]'' opened on Broadway. The play was a critical success and a commercial flop. Despite two [[Tony Award]] nominations, a Tony win for the acting of [[Brian Backer]] (who won the 1981 [[Theater World Award]] and a [[Drama Desk Award]] for his work), the play only ran for 62 performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Broadway League |url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=4112 |title=Internet Broadway Database: The Floating Light Bulb Production Credits |publisher=Ibdb.com |accessdate=March 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a long hiatus from the stage, Allen returned to the theatre in 1995, with the one-act ''Central Park West'', an installment in an evening of theatre known as ''Death Defying Acts'' that was also made up of new work by [[David Mamet]] and [[Elaine May]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mamet.eserver.org/review/1995/death.html |title=Death Defying Acts and No One Shall Be Immune – David Mamet Society |publisher=Mamet.eserver.org |accessdate=March 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film, tentatively titled ''American Blues'', would follow the vastly different careers of [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[Sidney Bechet]]. Allen stated that the film would cost between $80 and $100&amp;nbsp;million and is therefore unlikely to be made.&lt;ref&gt;Lax, Eric; Allen, Woody (2007).

== Personal life ==
Allen was married three times, to Harlene Rosen (m. 1956–1959), [[Louise Lasser]] (m. 1966–1970) and [[Soon-Yi Previn]] (m. 1997–present). He also had a 12-year relationship with actor [[Mia Farrow]] and relationships with [[Stacey Nelkin]] and [[Diane Keaton]].

===Early marriages and relationships===
Allen married 17-year-old Harlene Rosen when he was 20 in 1956; the marriage lasted until 1959.&lt;ref name="timemag-3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,877848-3,00.html |title=Woody Allen: Rabbit Running |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |page=3 |date=July 3, 1972 |accessdate=August 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosen, whom Allen referred to in his standup act as "the Dread Mrs. Allen", [[lawsuit|sued]] him for [[defamation]] as a result of comments he made during a television appearance shortly after their divorce. In his mid-1960s standup album ''Standup Comic'', Allen said that Rosen had sued him because of a joke he made in an interview. Rosen had been [[raped|sexually assaulted]] outside her apartment. According to Allen, the newspapers reported that she had been "violated". In the interview, Allen said, "Knowing my ex-wife, it probably wasn't a [[moving violation]]." In an interview on ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'', Allen repeated his comments and said he had been sued for "$1&amp;nbsp;million."&lt;ref name=CavettTube&gt;{{cite web|title=Dick &amp; Woody discuss particle physics|url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xq5Nh2UqCc#t=309|accessdate=November 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen married [[Louise Lasser]] in 1966. They divorced in 1970. Lasser appeared in three Allen films shortly before and after the divorce—''Take the Money and Run'', ''Bananas'', and ''Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)''—and later briefly appeared in ''Stardust Memories''. In 1969 Allen cast [[Diane Keaton]] in his Broadway show, ''[[Play It Again, Sam (film)|Play It Again, Sam]].'' During the run she and Allen became romantically involved. Although they broke up after a year, she continued to star in his films, including ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'' as a futuristic poet and ''[[Love and Death]]'' as a composite character based on the novels of [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky]]. ''[[Annie Hall]]'' was very important in Allen's and Keaton's careers. It is said that the role was written for her, as Diane Keaton's birth name was Diane Hall. She then starred in ''[[Interiors]]'' as a poet, followed by ''[[Manhattan (film)|Manhattan]]''. In 1987, she had a cameo as a nightclub singer in ''[[Radio Days]]'', and she was chosen to replace [[Mia Farrow]] in ''[[Manhattan Murder Mystery]]'' after Allen and Farrow began having problems with their relationship. As of 2004 Keaton and Allen remained close friends.&lt;ref name="cbs"&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/02/18/48hours/main600975.shtml Q&amp;A: Diane Keaton]. CBS News. February 18, 2004.

=== Mia Farrow  ===
Allen and [[Mia Farrow]] met in 1979 and began a 12-year relationship in 1980;&lt;ref name=Lax24Feb1991/&gt; Farrow starred in 13 of Allen's films from 1982 to 1992.&lt;ref name=CNN11May2016&gt;{{cite news|title=Woody Allen, Mia Farrow family tree|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/03/showbiz/gallery/allen-farrow-family-tree/index.html|publisher=CNN|date=May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the relationship they lived in separate apartments on opposite sides of [[Central Park]] in Manhattan. Farrow had seven children when they met; there were three biological sons from her marriage to composer [[André Previn]], three adopted girls (two Vietnamese and one Korean, [[Soon-Yi Previn]]), and one adopted Korean boy, Moses Farrow.&lt;ref name=Lax24Feb1991&gt;{{cite news | title=Woody and Mia: A New York Story |author=Lax, Eric |newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 24, 1991

In 1984 she and Allen tried to have a biological child together; Allen agreed to this on the understanding that he need not be involved in the child's care. When the effort to get pregnant failed, Farrow adopted a baby girl, [[Dylan Farrow]], in July 1985. Allen was not involved in the adoption, but when Dylan arrived he assumed a parental role toward her and began spending more time in Farrow's home.&lt;ref name=Stern10Feb2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stern|first1=Marlow|title=Inside the Shocking Custody Case Court Documents that Shed Light on the Dylan Farrow-Woody Allen Saga|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/inside-the-shocking-custody-case-court-documents-that-shed-light-on-the-dylan-farrow-woody-allen-saga|work=The Daily Beast|date=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 19, 1987, Farrow gave birth to Allen's biological child, Satchel Farrow (later known as [[Ronan Farrow]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/22/arts/son-born-to-mia-farrow-and-woody-allen.html | title = Son Born to Mia Farrow And Woody Allen | agency = Associated Press |newspaper=The New York Times | date= December 22, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ronan&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2013/10/mia-farrow-children-family-scandal |title=Exclusive: Mia Farrow and Eight of Her Children Speak Out on Their Lives, Frank Sinatra, and the Scandals They've Endured |date=October 2, 2013 |work=Vanity Fair |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031041558/http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2013/10/mia-farrow-children-family-scandal |archivedate=October 31, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 Farrow wanted to adopt another child. According to a 1993 custody hearing, Allen told her he would not object to another adoption so long as she would agree to his adoption of Dylan and Moses; that adoption was finalized in December 1991.&lt;ref name=Stern10Feb2014/&gt; [[Eric Lax]], Allen's biographer, wrote in ''The New York Times'' in February 1991 that Allen was "there before they [the children] wake up in the morning, he sees them during the day and he helps put them to bed at night".&lt;ref name=Lax24Feb1991/&gt;

===Soon-Yi Previn===
[[File:Soon Yi Previn and Woody Allen at the Tribeca Film Festival.jpg|thumb|[[Soon-Yi Previn]] and Allen, 2009]]
In 1978 Farrow and André Previn adopted Soon-Yi Previn, who had been abandoned in the slums of [[Seoul]]. At the time of the adoption, her passport said that she was seven; a [[bone scan]] in the US reportedly determined that she was between five and seven.{{efn|[[Maureen Orth]] (''Vanity Fair'', November 1992): "Nobody knows how old Soon-Yi really is. Without ever seeing her, Korean officials put her age down as seven on her passport. A bone scan Mia had done on her in the U.S. put her age at between five and seven. In the family, Soon-Yi is considered to have turned 20 this year [1992], on October 8.&lt;ref name=OrthNov1992/&gt;}} Living with Farrow, Soon-Yi is said to have had little contact with Allen until 1990, when she asked to accompany him to a basketball game. They attended more games together and by 1991 had become closer.&lt;ref name=Stern10Feb2014/&gt; In September 1991 she began her studies at [[Drew University]] in New Jersey.&lt;ref name=Hoban21Sept1992/&gt;

In January 1992, Farrow found nude photographs of 22-year-old Soon-Yi in Allen's home. Allen, then 57, told Farrow that he had taken them the day before, around two weeks after he first had sex with Soon-Yi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Perez-Pena|first1=Richard|title=Nude Photographs Are Focus Of Woody Allen's Testimony|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/23/nyregion/nude-photographs-are-focus-of-woody-allen-s-testimony.html|work=The New York Times|date=March 23, 1993|archivedate=January 17, 2018|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20180117221845/https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/23/nyregion/nude-photographs-are-focus-of-woody-allen-s-testimony.html|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in a bitter breakup of Farrow's and Allen's relationship; both parties instructed lawyers shortly after the photographs were discovered.&lt;ref name=Stern10Feb2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=OrthNov1992/&gt; That summer, Soon-Yi was asked to leave summer camp because she was spending too much time taking calls from a "Mr. Simon", who turned out to be Allen.&lt;ref name=Hoban21Sept1992&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hoban|first1=Phoebe|title=Woody and Mia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3uQCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA40|work=New York Magazine|date=September 21, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen issued a statement on August 17, 1992, saying that he was in love with Soon-Yi.&lt;ref name=Weber18Aug1992&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weber|first1=Bruce|title=Public Disclosures From the Private Life of Woody Allen|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/18/nyregion/public-disclosures-from-the-private-life-of-woody-allen.html|work=The New York Times|date=August 18, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were married in [[Venice, Italy]] on December 23, 1997,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Collins|first1=Glenn|title=Mixed Reviews Greet Woody Allen Marriage|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/25/nyregion/mixed-reviews-greet-woody-allen-marriage.html|work=The New York Times|date=December 25, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; and adopted two children, Bechet and Manzie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Woody Allen and Wife Have a Baby Daughter|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/27/nyregion/metro-news-briefs-new-york-woody-allen-and-wife-have-a-baby-daughter.html|work=The New York Times|date=April 29, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shoard|first1=Catherine|title=Woody Allen: 'There are traumas in life that weaken us.

=== Assault allegation===
{{main|Woody Allen sexual assault allegation}}
According to court testimony, on August 4, 1992, Allen visited the children at Mia Farrow's home in [[Bridgewater, Connecticut|Bridgewater]], Connecticut, while she was out shopping with a friend.&lt;ref name=OrthNov1992/&gt; The following day, that friend's babysitter told her employer that she had seen Allen behaving inappropriately with Dylan.&lt;ref name=MarksApril101993&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marks|first1=Peter|title=Sitter Questions Allen Actions With Daughter|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/10/nyregion/sitter-questions-allen-actions-with-daughter.html|work=The New York Times|date=April 10, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Farrow asked Dylan about it, Dylan alleged that Allen had touched Dylan's "private part" while they were alone together in the attic.&lt;ref name=OrthNov1992&gt;{{cite news |last=Orth|first=Maureen|title=Mia's Story|magazine=Vanity Fair|date=August 5, 2008|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/archive/1992/11/farrow199211|accessdate=November 16, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221205817/http://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/archive/1992/11/farrow199211|archive-date=November 1992|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; One woman employed to care for Farrow's children said that for about 20 minutes that afternoon she had not known where Dylan was, while a second said that, at one point, Dylan had been wearing no underwear under her dress.&lt;ref name=MarksApril101993/&gt; Farrow told Dylan's pediatrician, who informed authorities.&lt;ref name=Orth7Feb2014&gt;{{cite web|last1=Orth|first1=Maureen|title=10 Undeniable Facts About the Woody Allen Sexual-Abuse Allegation|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2014/02/woody-allen-sex-abuse-10-facts|website=Vanity Fair|date=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OrthNov2013&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2013/11/mia-farrow-frank-sinatra-ronan-farrow| title=Momma Mia!| first=Maureen|last=Orth|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]| date= November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being told about the allegation, Allen began proceedings in [[New York Supreme Court]] for sole custody of his and Farrow's biological son, Satchel, as well as Dylan and Moses, the two adopted children of Farrow that Allen had adopted as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weber|first1=Bruce|title=Woody Allen Files Child-Custody Lawsuit|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/14/nyregion/woody-allen-files-child-custody-lawsuit.html|work=The New York Times|date=August 14, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; He strongly denied the allegation, calling it "an unconscionable and gruesomely damaging manipulation of innocent children for vindictive and self-serving motives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barron|first1=James|title=Striking Back, Woody Allen Denies Child Sex-Abuse Allegation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/19/nyregion/striking-back-woody-allen-denies-child-sex-abuse-allegation.html|work=The New York Times|date=August 19, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; A months-long investigation by the Child Sexual Abuse Clinic of [[Yale–New Haven Hospital]] concluded that Dylan had not been sexually assaulted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Perez-Pena|first1=Richard|title=Woody Allen Says Report Clears Him|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/19/nyregion/woody-allen-says-report-clears-him.html|work=The New York Times|date=March 19, 1993}}{{pb}}

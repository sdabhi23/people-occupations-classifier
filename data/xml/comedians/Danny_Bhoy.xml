'''Danny Bhoy''' (born '''Danni Chaudhry''' on {{birth date|1975|01|16|df=y}}) is a Scottish comedian who has performed in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Sweden and the United States.

== Early life ==

Bhoy was born in [[Moffat]], Scotland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Danny Bhoy|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/comics/d/107/danny_bhoy|work=Chortle|accessdate=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as one of four children and attended [[Lockerbie Academy]] and [[Merchiston Castle School]] in Edinburgh. His father is of [[Indian people|Indian]] descent and his mother is [[Scottish people|Scottish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/04/04/1048962928184.html |work=[[The Age]] |title=Bhoy's own story |date=7 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His humour is observational, often involving his own personal experiences as an international comedian. While he does mention his Indian heritage, his shows centre on Scottish social patterns. Despite his stage name, Bhoy, he is not a [[Celtic F.C.]] fan (Celtic are nicknamed ''The Bhoys''), his favourite team is in fact [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Katey |last=Wallace

}}&lt;/ref&gt; His stage name actually stems from his grandma's nickname for him, Danny Boy, but due to a performing dog already having that name registered with [[Equity (trade union)|Equity]], he added the H to Bhoy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Career ==

Bhoy began stand up in 1998 after going to see his first comedy show at the [[Edinburgh Fringe|Edinburgh Festival]]. A year later, he won The Daily Telegraph Open Mic Award,&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1999/08/99/edinburgh_festival_99/429206.stm | work=BBC News | title=Danny Bhoy's pipe dream comes true | date=25 August 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Britain's biggest competition for comedy newcomers. In 2001, Danny took his first full-length solo show to the Edinburgh Festival, where, within a week, he had sold out his entire three-week run, and added extra shows to cope with the demand for tickets.&lt;ref name="bhoy"&gt;[http://www.dannybhoy.com Bhoy's official website]&lt;/ref&gt; By the spring of 2003, Danny's comedy started to take a different direction. That year he also entered the Australian comedy market, with his first solo show at the invitation-only [[Melbourne Comedy Festival]]. This led to various Australian TV appearances on ''[[Rove Live]]'', ''[[The Glass House (2001 TV series)|The Glass House]]'', and the Melbourne International Comedy Festival Gala. In November of that year, Danny was invited to perform on the Royal Variety Show.&lt;ref name="bhoy" /&gt;

In 2005, Danny was invited to take part in the Montreal [[Just for Laughs]] Comedy Festival, where the Montreal Gazette described him as "the stand out hit of the festival". In November, Danny was invited to take part in the inaugural Las Vegas Comedy Festival.  Bhoy toured Australia in 2007, ending his tour at the Sydney Opera House,&lt;ref name="bhoy2007"&gt;[http://www.dannybhoy.com/tour-dates/2007-tour-date/ 2007 Tour Dates] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621070644/http://www.dannybhoy.com/tour-dates/2007-tour-date/ |date=21 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2009 with the last show at Her Majesty's Theatre, Perth.&lt;ref name="bhoy2009"&gt;[http://www.dannybhoy.com/tour-dates/2009-tour-dates/ 2009 Tour Dates] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621064307/http://www.dannybhoy.com/tour-dates/2009-tour-dates/ |date=21 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhoy appeared on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', broadcast on 5 March 2010, and the [[Comedy Network]]'s "Saturday Night Stand-up", which was broadcast on 17 April 2010. He appeared on [[Comedy Central]] with his new routine, "Subject to Change: Danny Bhoy", which was broadcast on 22 May 2010, and appeared on ''[[Live at the Apollo (TV series)|Live at the Apollo]]'', broadcast in December 2010.

In early 2011, Danny began touring around Australia with his show Messenger (Please Do Not Shoot), selling out his shows at the [[Sydney Comedy Festival]]. He also sold out all his shows at the Melbourne Comedy Festival, and had to add two separate shows at a different venue to his other shows due to popular demand. These shows were also sold out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/funnyman-danny-bhoy-is-back-in-the-country-but-cant-decide-whether-to-live-in-sydney-or-melbourne/story-e6frewz0-1225985706197 |title=Funnyman Danny Bhoy is back in the country but can't decide whether to live in Sydney or Melbourne |work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]] |location=Sydney, Australia |first=Ross |last=Purdie |date=11 January 2011 |accessdate=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhoy's 2012 show, ''Dear Epson'', was loosely centred upon a series of letters to well-known companies. He toured the show following a run at the Edinburgh Fringe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Review: Danny Bhoy: Dear Epson – Newcastle Stand

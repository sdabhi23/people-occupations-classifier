(TV series)|Would I Lie to You?]]''. 
She is currently the presenter of ''[[The Great British Bake Off: An Extra Slice]]''.

In 2003, Brand was listed in ''[[The Observer]]'' as one of the 50 funniest acts in British comedy.

==Early life==
Brand was born in Hastings, East Sussex. &lt;ref name="I"/&gt; Her mother was a [[social worker]] and her father was a [[structural engineer]]. Brand is the middle of three children, with two brothers.&lt;ref name=Vincent /&gt; When she was about four, the family moved to the village of [[St Mary's Platt]] near [[Sevenoaks]] in [[Kent]],&lt;ref name=KentishMaid /&gt; and a year later, to [[Benenden]].&lt;ref name=KentishMaid /&gt; Brand was educated at St Mary's Platt Primary School, Benenden Village Primary School, [[Tunbridge Wells Girls' Grammar School]] until the age of 16, [[Helenswood School|Hastings High School for Girls]] and [[Bexhill College]].&lt;ref name=autobiography /&gt;

After working in a pub, for [[Barnardo's]] and as a nursing assistant in a residential unit for adults with learning disabilities she took a joint social science degree with a [[Nursing in the United Kingdom|Registered Mental Nurse]] qualification at [[Brunel University]]. She then worked as a [[psychiatric nurse]] for ten years, at the [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|South London Bethlem]], [[Cefn Coed Hospital]] in [[Swansea]] and [[Maudsley Hospital]] in south London.&lt;ref name=Atkins /&gt;&lt;ref name=stanley&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hxRMDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA162&amp;lpg=PA162|title=Clinical Leadership in Nursing and Healthcare: Values into Action|first=David|last=Stanley|date=19 October 2016|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|accessdate=8 May 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Comedy===
Brand was persuaded by agent [[Malcolm Hardee]] to begin a career in stand-up comedy, where she acquired the stage name the "Sea Monster". She was part of the British [[alternative comedy]] movement, working in London alternative comedy clubs in the mid-1980s, and appearing initially on the ''[[Saturday Live (UK TV series)|Saturday Live]]'' television show. She shared a flat with fellow comic and comedy club owner [[Ivor Dembina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brand|first1=Jo|title=Can't Stand Up for Sitting Down|date=2010|publisher=Headline Review|location=London|isbn=978-0755355266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her first gig, she faced "an audience from hell" and, waiting to perform last, drank seven pints of lager. She thus faced her first live audience with a bursting bladder. As Brand ascended the stage, a male heckler started shouting, "Fuck off, you fat cow" and kept up the abuse until her performance finished. There was no applause at the end of her act.&lt;ref name="I"/&gt;

Brand's early style involved her delivering jokes in a bored monotone, one line at a time, with pauses in between. It drew heavily from pop culture and the media, with many jokes containing references to well-known celebrities and public figures. With her [[Doc Marten]] boots, her large size, and her short hair, her image remained the same for most of the 1980s and 1990s. Her appearance and material led to false rumours that she was a [[lesbian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/coventry/content/articles/2005/10/26/jo_brand_review_feature.shtml "Jo Brand is one funny woman"], BBC interview, 26 October 2005 (viewed 9 July 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jo Brand 1994.jpg|thumb|upright|Jo Brand in 1994 in [[Belfast]]]]

In 2010, Brand took part in ''[[Channel 4's Comedy Gala]]'', a [[Benefit concert|benefit show]] held in aid of [[Great Ormond Street Hospital|Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital]], filmed live at the [[The O2 Arena (London)|O2 Arena]] in London on 30 March.

Brand played the Demon Dinner Lady in the 2011 [[British cinema|British]] live-action film ''[[Horrid Henry the Movie]]''. She also provided a voiceover for the Lyric Hammersmith Theatre's 2011 pantomime Aladdin.

In August 2015, Brand judged the first ever Class Clowns competition at the [[Edinburgh Fringe Festival]], she also announced the winner at the [[Gilded Balloon]] on the night.

Brand has written a feature-film adaptation to her novel ''The More You Ignore Me''. She will also star in the film.

===Television===
In 1993, Brand became a resident panellist, along with [[Tony Hawks]], on BBC monologue show ''[[The Brain Drain]]''. Her transition into mainstream television continued when she starred in her own series on [[Channel 4]], ''[[Jo Brand Through the Cakehole]]'', co-written with comedy writer Jim Miller, who was already her main stand-up writer. Brand has had several solo television series, and presented shows such as ''[[Commercial Breakdown|Jo Brand's Commercial Breakdown]]''. She had a [[cameo appearance|cameo]] appearance in a 1994 episode of ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]'' entitled "New Best Friend", and also appeared on ''[[Star Spell]]'', a spin-off from ''[[Hard Spell]]'' in 2004. Her television success continued with guest appearances on shows such as ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'' and ''[[QI]]'', to the extent where she became the most frequently appearing guest on the latter, appearing in a total of 34 episodes. As a fan of ''[[Countdown (game show)|Countdown]]'', Brand achieved an ambition when she was invited to appear in the show's "Dictionary Corner" as the celebrity guest. She later became a friend of the host, [[Richard Whiteley]], and after his death in 2005 attended his [[funeral|memorial service]] at [[York Minster]]. She has appeared on ''Countdown'' as a Dictionary Corner guest 88 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jo Brand - Countdown|url=http://wiki.apterous.org/Jo_Brand|website=Apterous Wiki|accessdate=27 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 March 2007, Brand appeared on ''[[Play It Again]]'' where she was required to learn how to play the [[organ (music)|organ]] in just four months. This was in preparation to perform [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s [[Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565|Toccata and Fugue in D Minor]] for an audience of 8,000 people at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]] on the second largest [[pipe organ]] in the United Kingdom. In order to practise her performance, she played [[Dear Lord and Father of Mankind]] – a favourite hymn of hers at a church service in her former village church in Benenden, Kent, and accompanied dancers at [[Blackpool Tower]].

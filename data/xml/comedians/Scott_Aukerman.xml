'''Scott Aukerman''' (born July 2, 1970) is an [[United States|American]] writer, actor, comedian, television personality, director, producer, and podcast host. Starting as a writer and performer in the later seasons of the sketch series ''[[Mr. Show with Bob and David|Mr. Show]]'', Aukerman is best known as the host of the weekly comedy podcast ''[[Comedy Bang! Bang!]]'' as well as the [[IFC (U.S. TV channel)|IFC]] [[Comedy Bang! Bang! (TV series)|original television series of the same name]]. Aukerman is the co-creator of ''[[Between Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis]]'' and co-founder of the [[Earwolf]] podcast network.

==Early life==
Aukerman was born in [[Savannah, Georgia]] to Burt and Linda Aukerman. He grew up in [[Orange County, California]], attending [[Cypress High School]] and the [[Orange County High School of the Arts]], studying acting and musical theater and writing plays in his spare time. He hosted a public-access television show called Centurion Highlights, based on the school's mascot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/issue-sections/features-issue-sections/13560/scott-aukerman-comedy-bang-bang-interview/|title=How Scott Aukerman built an empire of absurdist comedy|website=kernelmag.dailydot.com|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BA"&gt;{{cite web|title=BA #100: Scott Aukerman|url=http://boxangeles.com/2015/10/11/ba-100-scott-aukerman/|website=the Box Angeles podcast}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a 2015 interview, Aukerman said "I'm still doing that same show, just with celebrities instead of my high school cafeteria."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sankin|first1=Aaron|title=How Scott Aukerman built an empire of absurdist comedy|url=http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/issue-sections/features-issue-sections/13560/scott-aukerman-comedy-bang-bang-interview/?tw=kr#sthash.wKy30Z2T.dpuf|date=July 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started a short-lived band, The Naked Postmen, with [[Adrian Young]], who went on to be the drummer for [[No Doubt]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''[[Never Not Funny]]'' podcast - Episode 4.11&lt;/ref&gt; 

While attending [[Orange Coast College]] in [[Costa Mesa]], he and fellow student [[B. J. Porter]] began writing together when they were both scripting and performing in a radio show called ''Lutz Radio''.&lt;ref name="BA"/&gt;

==Career==
After a brief period studying at the [[Pacific Conservatory of the Performing Arts]] and touring the country as a musical theater actor, in 1995, at the request of his friends, Aukerman and Porter started performing at [[The Comedy Store]] in [[Los Angeles]] under the moniker "The Fun Bunch", a name meant to parody [[improvisation]] groups at the time.&lt;ref name="BA"/&gt;

''[[Mr. Show with Bob and David|Mr. Show]]'' co-creator [[Bob Odenkirk]] was in the audience for the second performance, and soon tapped the duo to write for and occasionally perform on the show in its fourth season. This led to an [[Emmy]] nomination in 1999 for Aukerman and the rest of the staff. Aukerman appeared sporadically on the show, most notably as the model Theo Brixton in the Taint Magazine sketch.

After the show's cancellation, Aukerman and Porter segued into writing film and television scripts, most notably ''[[Run Ronnie Run!]]'' and the first draft of the film ''[[Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny]]''. In 2004, he and Porter received an "Additional Dialogue" credit on the animated feature film ''[[Shark Tale]]''. They went on to write an unproduced script for the sequel, as well as an unproduced ''[[Shrek]]'' spin-off film based on the character [[Puss in Boots (Shrek)|Puss in Boots]]. In 2007, a feature film script he wrote with Porter and Odenkirk, titled ''Kanan Rhodes: Unkillable Servant of Justice'', was purchased by [[MTV Films]] with the intent of starring [[Rainn Wilson]], although it currently remains unproduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/rainn-wilson-kanan-rhodes/ |title=Rainn Wilson IS Kanan Rhodes |date=January 5, 2007 |accessdate=January 5, 2007|work=Empire }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2007, Aukerman released a self-described "joke record", ''Scott Aukerman's Koo Koo Roo's Greatest Hits'', which featured Aukerman and ''Sarah Silverman Program'' writer Jon Schroeder shouting over current soft-rock hits. This was put out in limited release on AST Records.

In 2009, Aukerman and Porter wrote a pilot script for NBC, titled ''Privates''. The network ultimately passed on the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/2009/scene/markets-festivals/writers-pact-with-universal-tv-1118001444/|title=Writers pact with Universal TV |accessdate=March 19, 2009 |work= Variety | first=Michael | last=Schneider | date=March 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Aukerman took on the role as head writer for the [[2009 MTV Movie Awards]] and executive produced and co-wrote a pilot for [[Comedy Central]], ''The New Andy Dick Show''. The network ultimately passed on ordering it to series.

In 2010, Aukerman wrote a feature film script for friend [[Zach Galifianakis]] for Fox, and he and [[Patton Oswalt]] co-wrote a television pilot for Fox, which the network ultimately passed on. Later that year, Aukerman joined a "writers lab", writing film scripts for [[Imagine Entertainment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deadline.com/2010/12/imagine-and-reliance-big-launch-writers-lab-90427/|title=Imagine And Reliance Launch Writers Lab|last=Fleming|first=Mike|accessdate=December 13, 2011|work= Deadline | date=December 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Comedy Death-Ray''/''Comedy Bang! Bang!''===
In 2002, Aukerman and Porter started the successful [[alternative comedy]] showcase [[Comedy Death-Ray]], which ran Tuesday night at the M Bar in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mensjournal.com/travel/the-future-of-talk-with-scott-aukerman-20140605/|title=Discussing the Future Of Talk With Scott Aukerman|date=2014-06-05|work=Men's Journal|access-date=2018-03-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Porter had friends in common with M Bar owner Joe Reynolds, and visited the bar shortly after its opening. Upon seeing how empty M Bar was, Porter convinced Reynolds to let him start a comedy show to help business. The show eventually moved to the [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre]] in 2005 to gain more creative freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.funbunchcomedy.com/weblog/archives/2005/07/the_ast_intervi_2.html |title=Fun Bunch Interview with ASpecialThing.com |accessdate=March 18, 2007 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A Comedy Death-Ray CD taped partially in San Francisco at the [[SF Sketchfest]] and partially at their fourth-anniversary, all-night show in LA was released on [[Comedy Central Records]] on September 11, 2007. The CD featured Aukerman, comedians [[David Cross]], [[Patton Oswalt]], [[Paul F. Tompkins]], and other CDR regulars.

In 2007, Aukerman and Porter produced several internet shorts with Comedy Death-Ray comedians for the internet site [[Super Deluxe]]. These included three episodes of ''The [[Brody Stevens]] Interview Challenge'', and two episodes of ''Lake Charles Lake'', in which he also co-starred. They made more shorts in 2008, but the site was shut down and folded into [[Adult Swim]] before they could air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newteevee.com/2008/05/08/superdeluxe-to-sink-into-adult-swim/ |title=Super Deluxe Sinks Into Adult Swim |accessdate=May 8, 2008 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Aukerman and [[B. J. Porter]] created and produced a sketch pilot, titled ''The Right Now! Show'', based on their show for [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dead-frog.com/blog/entry/interview_scott_aukerman_and_bj_porter_comedy_death_ray/ |title=Dead Frog Interview: Scott Aukerman &amp; BJ Porter |accessdate=September 12, 2007 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the network passed on ordering it to series in late 2007. Cast member [[Casey Wilson]] was immediately hired as a featured cast member of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' after the news. A short film made for the show, ''[[Between Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis]]'', eventually moved to internet site [[Funny Or Die]], becoming one of its most successful series.

Starting January 3, 2011, Aukerman became the host of a series of interview interstitials, titled ''Comedy Death-Ray'', airing three nights a week on the [[Independent Film Channel|IFC]] network, where he interviews stars and creators of shows that the network runs, including ''[[The Ben Stiller Show]]'', ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'', ''[[Mr. Show with Bob and David|Mr. Show]]'', ''[[Freaks &amp; Geeks]]'', ''[[Undeclared]]'', and ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]''.

In 2011, Aukerman and Porter parted ways, and ''Comedy Death-Ray'' was renamed ''[[Comedy Bang! Bang!]]''

===''Comedy Bang! Bang!: The Podcast''===
{{Main|Comedy Bang! Bang!}}
Being a frequent guest on and admirer of the award-winning podcast ''[[Never Not Funny]]'' with [[Jimmy Pardo]] led Aukerman to the decision that he should start his own comedy podcast. On May 1, 2009, Aukerman started to host ''[[Comedy Death-Ray Radio]]'', a comedy-themed broadcast based upon the live show, on Los Angeles radio station [[Indie 103.1]]. The show continued to air on Fridays at 12 noon Pacific, but moved to being distributed by the [[Earwolf]] podcasting network in 2010.&lt;ref name="Comedy Death-Ray Radio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scottaukerman.tumblr.com/post/101623752/comedy-death-ray-radio |title=Comedy Death-Ray Radio |accessdate=April 30, 2009 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The podcast of each show is available weekly on [[iTunes]] and the Earwolf website, and has been downloaded several million times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/comedy-bang-bang-500-episode-milestone-funniest-podcast-scott-aukerman|title=An Oral History of the Funniest Podcast Ever|last=Wilstein|first=Matt|date=2017-07-24|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=2018-03-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aukerman hosts, with frequent guest collaborators [[Paul F. Tompkins]], [[Lauren Lapkus]], Neil Campbell, Mike Hanford, [[James Adomian]], [[Nick Kroll]], [[Andy Daly]], and the late [[Harris Wittels]] among others, serving as guests and characters. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called the show "often strange, consistently hilarious, always unpredictable,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2011/06/23/comedy-podcasts-favorites-adam-carolla/ |title=Best Comedy Podcasts|last=Rottenberg|first=Josh|accessdate=February 26, 2018 |date=June 23, 2011|work= Entertainment Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The A.V.

Bang!''. On December 4, 2013, ''The A.V. Club'' named ''Comedy Bang! Bang!'' the best podcast of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The best podcasts of 2013|url=https://www.avclub.com/the-best-podcasts-of-2013-1798242290|website=AV Club|accessdate=February 26, 2018|date=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, ''Time Magazine'' named ''Comedy Bang! Bang!'' one of ''The 50 Best Podcasts to Listen to Right Now''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/5178078/best-podcasts-2018/|last=Dockterman|first=Eliana|title=The 50 Best Podcasts to Listen to Right Now|website=Time|language=en|date=April 2, 2018|access-date=April 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bang!]]'' On December 2, 2016, the series ended after five seasons and 110 episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tv.avclub.com/scott-aukerman-on-ending-the-comedy-bang-bang-tv-show-1798255014|title=Scott Aukerman on ending the Comedy Bang!

===''Between Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis''===
{{Main|Between Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis}}
One sketch from Aukerman and Porter's sketch show ''The Right Now! Show'', ''Between Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis'', was put up on internet site [[Funny Or Die]] and received several hundreds of thousands of hits in just a few days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/e8e4424115/between-two-ferns-with-zach-galifianakis-from-between-two-ferns-zach-galifianakis-michael-cera-and-comedy-deathray |title=Between Two Ferns: Michael Cera |accessdate=January 18, 2008 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was followed by ''Ferns'' interviews with talk-show host [[Jimmy Kimmel]], ''[[Mad Men]]'' star [[Jon Hamm]], [[Natalie Portman]], [[Bradley Cooper]], [[Charlize Theron]], [[Conan O'Brien]], [[Ben Stiller]], [[Steve Carell]], [[Sean Penn]], [[Bruce Willis]], [[Jennifer Aniston]], [[Will Ferrell]], "Oscar Buzz Edition" (featuring [[Jennifer Lawrence]], [[Christoph Waltz]], [[Naomi Watts]], [[Amy Adams]], [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Jessica Chastain]], [[Sally Field]] and [[Bradley Cooper]]), a collaboration video with [[The Lonely Island]] and [[James Franco]], and a "Happy Holidays Edition" featuring [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Tobey Maguire]] and [[Arcade Fire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.funnyordie.com/comedydeathray/videos |title=Comedy Death-Ray's Videos on Funny Or Die |accessdate=January 18, 2008 |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107052659/http://www.funnyordie.com/comedydeathray/videos |archivedate=January 7, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aukerman directed the Theron, O'Brien, Penn, Willis, Ferrell, "Oscar Buzz," Bieber, Franco &amp; "Happy Holidays Edition" episodes.

In March 2014, an episode was released with President [[Barack Obama]]. It was designed to bring attention to the [[Affordable Care Act]]. Galifianakis engaged in his regular [[insult comedy]] style of interviewing, which the President reciprocated throughout the interview. Within 24 hours, the video of this interview had amassed upwards of 14 million views. Aukerman directed and produced this episode, which won the 2014 [[Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Short-Format Live-Action Entertainment Program|Outstanding Short-Format Live-Action Entertainment Program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=66th Emmy Awards Nominees and Winners: Outstanding Short-Format Live-Action Entertainment Program|url=https://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/2014/outstanding-special-class-short-format-live-action-entertainment-programs|website=Television Academy|accessdate=February 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each episode has been viewed millions of times, and the President [[Barack Obama]], [[Hillary Clinton]], [[Justin Bieber]], [[Brad Pitt]], and [[Natalie Portman]] episodes have become some of [[Funny Or Die]]'s most popular videos ever.

In 2015, Aukerman won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Short-Format Live-Action Entertainment Program]] again, this time for the [[Brad Pitt]] episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=67th Emmy Awards Nominees and Winners: Outstanding Short-Format Live-Action Entertainment Program|url=https://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/2015/outstanding-special-class-short-format-live-action-entertainment-programs|website=Television Academy|accessdate=February 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earwolf===
{{Main|Earwolf}}
In 2010, based upon the success of his podcast, Aukerman, along with Jeff Ullrich, started the Earwolf network, eventually producing and releasing several podcasts. In 2011, they announced a partnership with [[Funny Or Die]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/20/funny-or-die-teams-with-earwolf-podcasting_n_905225.html |title=Funny Or Die And Earwolf To Team Up, Expose Comedy Podcasts To Wider Audience |accessdate=July 20, 2011 |work= Huffington Post |first=Ross |last=Luippold |date=July 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, they launched a sister network [[Earwolf#Wolfpop|Wolfpop]], under the curation of comedian [[Paul Scheer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ryan|first1=Kyle|title=Paul Scheer to launch new podcasting network from Earwolf Media|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2014/11/04/paul-scheer-earwolf-wolfpop-podcasting|website=Entertainment Weekly|date=November 4, 2014|accessdate=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Aukerman started a limited-run podcast with actor [[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott]] entitled ''U Talkin' U2 To Me?'', which is ostensibly devoted to the career and discography of the band [[U2]]. Most episodes combine discussion of the band with running gags and comedy bits only marginally related to the band.&lt;ref name="UTU2TM"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/express/wp/2014/09/11/the-return-of-u-talkin-u2-to-me-is-the-best-part-of-the-new-u2-album/ |title=The return of ‘U Talkin' U2 to Me?' is the best part of the new U2 album |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=September 11, 2014 |last=Greenberg|first=Rudi|accessdate= May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, Aukerman and Scott started a continuation of the podcast called ''R U Talkin' R.E.M.

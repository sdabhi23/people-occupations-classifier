From April 2007 to April 2009 he presented the weekday breakfast show on Xfm.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|title=Zane steps into Laverne's shoes|publisher=[[Guardian Unlimited]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/apr/20/radio|date=20 April 2007|accessdate=23 December 2007 | location=London | first=Stephen | last=Brook}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zane and his team ([[Marc Haynes]] and [[Sunta Templeton]]) were suspended from the show in August 2008 after he broadcast a self-created song about rape, deemed to be offensive by the station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DJ Alex Zane suspended after playing 'joke' song about rape|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1048526/DJ-Alex-Zane-suspended-playing-joke-song-rape.html|date=23 August 2008|accessdate=23 August 2008 | location=London| archiveurl= https://archive.is/20080824103412/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1048526/DJ-Alex-Zane-suspended-playing-joke-song-rape.html| archivedate= 24 August 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three returned a week later, with Zane accusing Xfm of "over-reacting in the extreme" and claiming that his song had been misinterpreted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gigwise.com/news/45686/axed-alex-zane-accuses-xfm-of-overreacting|title='Axed' Alex Zane Accuses XFM of Over-Reacting|publisher=Gigwise.com|accessdate=25 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7586406.stm|title=DJ Zane's anger at XFM suspension|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=25 September 2008 | date=28 August 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080906124500/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7586406.stm| archivedate= 6 September 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zane left Xfm in April 2009, with the station stating that his sudden departure was by "mutual agreement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2009/apr/23/xfm-where-next-alex-zane|title=Where does Xfm go next?|author=Paul Smith|work=the Guardian|accessdate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Lapkus was born in Evanston, Illinois, of half [[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]] and half [[Greeks|Greek]]/[[Serbs|Serbian]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/laurenlapkus/status/358036718697451521|title=Lauren Lapkus on Twitter|work=Twitter|accessdate=May 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At an early age she would film sketches with her older brother and later at [[Evanston Township High School]]&lt;ref name="BA"&gt;{{cite web|title=BA #088: Lauren Lapkus |url=http://boxangeles.com/2015/07/19/ba-088-lauren-lapkus/|date= July 19, 2015|website=the Box Angeles podcast}}&lt;/ref&gt; she participated in the annual student revue and variety show YAMO.&lt;ref name="BA"/&gt;

During her senior year of high school, she began taking improv classes at the [[iO Theater]].&lt;ref name="BA"/&gt; She would attend [[DePaul University]] graduating in 2008 with a degree in English, while she continued performing improv most nights.&lt;ref name="BA"/&gt; Lapkus credits watching a lot of television sitcoms and ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' while young with giving her the education to become a comedian.&lt;ref&gt;Lapkus, Lauren, "I sleep so well here," ''Chicagoly Magazine'', summer 2016, pp. 16-19, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon graduation, she moved to [[New York City]] for a year where she got involved with [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre]].&lt;ref name="BA"/&gt; After living in New York City for 15 months,&lt;ref name="BA"/&gt; she relocated to [[Los Angeles]] in 2010.&lt;ref name="SO Mag"/&gt;

==Career==
After almost a year in Los Angeles, Lapkus began landing roles in a number of commercials, including [[Snickers]] and [[Jack in the Box]]&lt;ref name="BA"/&gt; as well as a sketch on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]''.&lt;ref name="BA"/&gt; From these successes, she got herself representation and during pilot season landed a supporting role in the short lived ''[[Are You There, Chelsea?]]''.&lt;ref name="BA"/&gt;

After self-taping her audition, Lapkus was cast as security guard Susan Fischer on the first and second seasons of the [[Netflix]] series ''[[Orange is the New Black]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bust.com/podcast-pick-of-the-week-with-special-guest-lauren-lapkus.html |title=Podcast Pick of the Week: With Special Guest Lauren Lapkus}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Lapkus and the cast won the [[Screen Actors Guild Award]] for [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series|Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series]].

In 2014, Lapkus launched her own podcast on the [[Earwolf]] network, called ''[[With Special Guest Lauren Lapkus]]''. The show's premise is that each week her guest is the host of their own podcast, and she is appearing as a character on their show. Her guests have included [[Paul F. Tompkins]], [[Betsy Sodaro]], [[Andy Daly]], [[Nick Kroll]], and [[Scott Aukerman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/lauren-lapkus-podcasts-jurassic-world-and-landing--220294 |title=Lauren Lapkus on podcasts, Jurrasic World and Landing another TV Series |work=[[The A.V. Club]] |last=Ryan |first=Kyle |date=June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has said that she "never expected to get into podcasts at all" and to her it is funny she has one.&lt;ref name="BA"/&gt;

In mid-2014, Lapkus was cast in ''[[Jurassic World]]'', which she filmed in both [[Hawaii]] and [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref name="BA"/&gt; Many of her scenes with [[Jake Johnson]] were improvised.&lt;ref name="BA"/&gt; In 2015, she portrayed Joy the receptionist in [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]]'s ''[[Clipped (TV series)|Clipped.]]'' In 2016, Lapkus wrote and starred in her own 30-minute episode of the [[sketch show]] ''[[Netflix Presents: The Characters]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/netflix-orders-innovative-sketch-series-861049|title=Netflix Orders Innovative Sketch Series 'The Characters' (Exclusive)|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter|date=February 1, 2016|accessdate=February 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

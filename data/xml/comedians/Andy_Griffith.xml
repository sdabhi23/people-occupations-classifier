'''Andy Samuel Griffith''' (June 1, 1926 &amp;nbsp;– July 3, 2012) was an American actor, comedian, television producer, [[Southern Gospel|Southern gospel]] singer, and writer,&lt;ref&gt;[[Press release]] (September 9, 2005). [http://www.unc.edu/news/archives/sep05/griffith090905.htm "Andy Griffith to Donate Personal Collection to UNC's Southern Historical Collection]. [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]. Retrieved January 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; whose career spanned seven decades of music and television.

Known for his southern drawl, his characters with a folksy-friendly personality, and his gruff, gregarious voice, Griffith was a [[Tony Award]] nominee for two roles, and gained prominence in the starring role in [[film director|director]] [[Elia Kazan]]'s film ''[[A Face in the Crowd (film)|A Face in the Crowd]]'' (1957) before he became better known for his television roles, playing the lead roles of [[Andy Taylor (The Andy Griffith Show)|Andy Taylor]] in the [[sitcom]] ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' (1960–1968) and [[Ben Matlock]] in the [[legal drama]] ''[[Matlock (TV series)|Matlock]]'' (1986–1995).

==Early life and education==
Griffith was born on June 1, 1926 in [[Mount Airy, North Carolina]], the only child of Carl Lee Griffith and his wife, Geneva (Nunn).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/59/Andy-Griffith.html |title=Andy Griffith Biography (1926–) |publisher=Filmreference.com |accessdate=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a baby, Griffith lived with relatives until his parents could afford to buy a home. With neither a crib nor a bed, he slept in dresser drawers for several months. In 1929, when Griffith was three, his father began working as a helper or carpenter and purchased a home in Mount Airy's "[[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]]" south side.

Griffith grew up listening to music. By the time he entered school, he was well aware that he was from what many considered the "wrong side of the tracks". He was a shy student, but once he found a way to make his peers laugh, he began to come out of his shell and come into his own.

As a student at [[Mount Airy High School]], Griffith cultivated an interest in the arts, and he participated in the school's [[drama]] program. A growing love of music, particularly [[swing music|swing]], would change his life. Griffith was raised [[Baptist]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/playeraprofileof002609mbp/playeraprofileof002609mbp_djvu.txt |title=Full text of "The Player A Profile Of An Art" |publisher=Archive.org |accessdate=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and looked up to Ed Mickey, a minister at Grace [[Moravian Church]], who led the [[brass band]] and taught him to sing and play the [[trombone]]. Mickey nurtured Griffith's talent throughout high school until graduation in 1944. Griffith was delighted when he was offered a role in ''[[Lost Colony (play)|The Lost Colony]]'' by [[Paul Green (playwright)|Paul Green]], a play about [[Roanoke Island]] still performed today. He performed as a cast member of the play for several years, playing a variety of roles, until he finally landed the role of [[Walter Raleigh|Sir Walter Raleigh]], the [[namesake]] of North Carolina's capital.

He attended the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]] (UNC) in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]], and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Music]] [[academic degree|degree]] in 1949. He began college studying to be a Moravian preacher, but he changed his major to music and became a part of the school's [[PlayMakers Repertory Company#History of the Carolina Playmakers|Carolina Playmakers]]. At UNC, he was president of the UNC chapter of [[Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia]], America's oldest [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] for men in music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.sinfonia.org/aboutus.asp|publisher=Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia|accessdate=July 3, 2012|location=Evansville, IN|quote=Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia is the world's oldest and largest secret national fraternal society in music.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702195032/http://www.sinfonia.org/aboutus.asp|archivedate=July 2, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also played roles in several student [[operetta]]s, including ''[[The Chimes of Normandy]]'' (1946), and [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[The Gondoliers]]'' (1945), ''[[The Mikado]]'' (1948) and ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' (1949).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.unc.edu/ncc/pcoll/inv/P0035/P0035.html Collection Number: P0035, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Department of Dramatic Art Photographs and Related Materials, 1911-1970s"], University of North Carolina Libraries, Retrieved January 20, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduation, he taught music and drama for a few years at [[Goldsboro High School]] in [[Goldsboro, North Carolina]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.digitalnc.org/cdm/ref/collection/yearbooks/id/8506 Goldsboro High School 1951 yearbook]&lt;/ref&gt; where he taught, among others, [[Carl Kasell]].&lt;ref&gt;"So This Is Carl Kasell!" by Joanne Kaufman, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', December 18, 2007 (Retrieved March 21, 2011) [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119793136588435187]&lt;/ref&gt; He also began to write.

==Career==

===From rising comedian to film star===
Griffith's early career was as a [[monologue|monologist]], delivering long stories such as ''[[What It Was, Was Football]]'', which is told from the point of view of a naïve country preacher trying to figure out what was going on in a [[American football|football]] game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carolinafan.com/ar/02/020926_what_it_was.html |title=What It Was, Was Football |publisher=Carolinafan.com |date=September 26, 2002 |accessdate=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monologue was released as a single in 1953 on the [[Colonial Records]] label, and was a hit for Griffith, reaching number nine on the charts in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dmdb.org/cgi-bin/plinfo_view.pl?SYN053537 |title=details for What It Was, Was Football—Deacon Andy Griffith |publisher=Dmdb.org |accessdate=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Griffith starred in [[Ira Levin]]'s one-hour [[teleplay]] version of ''[[No Time for Sergeants]]'' (March 1955)&amp;nbsp;— a story about a country boy in the [[United States Air Force]]&amp;nbsp;— on ''[[The United States Steel Hour]]'', a television [[anthology series]]. He expanded that role in [[Ira Levin]]'s full-length theatrical version of [[No Time for Sergeants#Broadway play|the same name (October 1955)]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Database]] (undated). [http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=2543 "No Time for Sergeants"]. [[Internet Broadway Database]]. Retrieved January 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The role earned him a "Distinguished Supporting or Featured Dramatic Actor" nomination at the [[10th Tony Awards|1956 Tony Awards]], losing to [[Ed Begley]]. He did win the 1956 [[Theatre World Award]], however, a prize given for debut roles on Broadway. "Mr. Griffith does not have to condescend to Will Stockdale" (his role in the play), wrote [[Brooks Atkinson]] in ''[[The New York Times]]''. "All he has to do is walk on the stage and look the audience straight in the face. If the armed forces cannot cope with Will Stockdale, neither can the audience resist Andy Griffith."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Brooks Atkinson|date=October 21, 1955|title=Alvin Premiere for "No Time for Sergeants |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Griffith later reprised his role for the film version (1958) of ''[[No Time for Sergeants (1958 film)|No Time for Sergeants]]''; the film also featured [[Don Knotts]], as a [[corporal]] in charge of [[fine motor skill|manual-dexterity]] tests, marking the beginning of a lifelong association between Griffith and Knotts. ''No Time for Sergeants'' is considered the direct inspiration for the later television situation comedy ''[[Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/no-time-for-sergeants-1 |title=No Time for Sergeants: Information from |publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His only other New York stage appearance was the titular role in the 1959 musical ''[[Destry Rides Again (musical)|Destry Rides Again]]'', co-starring Dolores Gray. The show, with a score by Harold Rome, ran for 472 performances and more than a year. Griffith was nominated for "Distinguished Musical Actor" at the [[14th Tony Awards|1960 Tony Awards]], losing to [[Jackie Gleason]].

He also portrayed a [[United States Coast Guard|US Coast Guard]] sailor in the feature film ''[[Onionhead]]'' (1958); it was neither a critical nor a commercial success.

===Dramatic role in ''A Face in the Crowd'' (1957)===
[[File:Andy Griffith-Neal-Remick.jpg|thumb|Griffith with [[Lee Remick]] (l) and [[Patricia Neal]] (r) on the set of ''A Face in the Crowd'' (1957)]]
In 1957, Griffith made his film début starring in the film ''[[A Face in the Crowd (film)|A Face in the Crowd]]''. Although he plays a "country boy," this country boy is manipulative and power-hungry, a [[vagabond (person)|drifter]] who becomes a [[Television presenter|television host]] and uses his show as a gateway to political power. The film was directed by [[Elia Kazan]] and written by [[Budd Schulberg]] and co-stars [[Patricia Neal]], [[Walter Matthau]], [[Tony Franciosa]], and [[Lee Remick]] (in her film début as well).

A 2005 [[DVD]] reissue of ''A Face in the Crowd'' includes a mini-[[documentary film|documentary]] on the film, with comments from Schulberg and cast members Griffith, Franciosa, and Neal. In his interview, Griffith, revered for his wholesome image for decades, reveals a more complex side of himself. He recalls Kazan prepping him to shoot his first scene with Remick's teenaged [[baton twirling|baton twirler]], who captivates Griffith's character on a trip to [[Arkansas]]. Griffith also expresses his belief that the film was far more popular and respected in more recent decades than it was when originally released.

===Television roles===

====Early television roles====
Griffith's first appearance on television was in 1955 in the one-hour teleplay of ''No Time for Sergeants'' on ''The United States Steel Hour''. That was the first of two appearances on that series.

In 1960, Griffith appeared as a [[County (United States)|county]] [[sheriff]] (who was also a [[justice of the peace]] and the [[copy editing|editor]] of the local newspaper) in an [[episode]] of ''[[Make Room for Daddy]]'', starring [[Danny Thomas]]. This episode, in which Thomas's character is stopped for running a stop sign in a little town, served as a [[backdoor pilot]] for ''The Andy Griffith Show''. Both shows were produced by [[Sheldon Leonard]].

====''The Andy Griffith Show'' (1960–1968)====
[[File:Andy Griffith Julie Adams Andy Griffith Show 1962.JPG|thumb|left|Andy Griffith and [[Julie Adams]] in 1962]]
Beginning in September 1960, Griffith starred as [[Andy Taylor (The Andy Griffith Show)|Sheriff Andy Taylor]] in ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' for the [[CBS]] [[television network]]. The show took place in the fictional town of [[Mayberry]], North Carolina, where Taylor, a widower, was the sheriff and town [[wise old man|sage]]. The show was filmed at Desilu Studios, with exteriors filmed at [[RKO Forty Acres|Forty Acres]] in [[Culver City, California]].

From 1960 to 1965, the show co-starred [[character actor]] and comedian&amp;nbsp;— and Griffith's longtime friend&amp;nbsp;— [[Don Knotts]] in the role of [[Deputy sheriff|Deputy]] [[Barney Fife]], Taylor's best friend and comedy partner. He was also Taylor's cousin in the show at first, though later they dropped that cousin relationship and talked simply of knowing one another since boyhood. In the series premiere episode, in a conversation between the two, Fife calls Taylor "Cousin Andy", and Taylor calls Fife "Cousin Barney". The show also starred [[child actor]] [[Ron Howard]] (then known as Ronny Howard), who played Taylor's only child, Opie Taylor.

It was an immediate hit. Griffith never received a writing credit for the show, but he worked on the development of every script. Knotts was frequently lauded and won multiple [[Emmy Award]]s for his comedic performances (as did [[Frances Bavier]] in 1967), while Griffith was never nominated for an Emmy Award during the show's run.

[[File:Andy Griffith Lee Meriwether 1971.JPG|thumb|right|Publicity photo with [[Lee Meriwether]] for ''[[The New Andy Griffith Show]]'', 1971]]
In 1967, Griffith was under contract with CBS to do one more season of the show. However, he decided to quit the show to pursue a movie career and other projects. The series continued as ''[[Mayberry R.F.D.]]'', with [[Ken Berry]] starring as a widower [[farmer]] and many of the regular characters recurring, some regularly and some as guest appearances. Griffith served as [[executive producer]] (according to Griffith, he came in once a week to review the week's scripts and give input) and guest starred in five episodes (the pilot episode involved his marriage to [[Helen Crump]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Database]] (undated). [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062587/fullcredits "Full Cast and Crew for ''Mayberry R.F.D.'']. [[Internet Movie Database]]. Retrieved January 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He made final appearances as Taylor in the 1986 reunion [[television movie|television film]], ''[[Return to Mayberry]]'', with fellow co-star, [[Don Knotts]]. Two reunion specials followed in 1993&lt;ref name=1993reunion&gt;{{cite news|last=King|first=Susan|title=Nostalgia star of Andy Griffith reunion|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IUJWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XuoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1165,1773529&amp;dq=matlock+knotts&amp;hl=en|accessdate=July 3, 2012|newspaper=Gainesville Sun|date=February 7, 1993|location=Gainesville, FL|page=7D}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2003,&lt;ref name=2003-reunion-a&gt;{{cite news|last=Gilbert|first=Matthew|title=Remembering the warm glow of Mayberry|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/tv/articles/2003/11/11/remembering_the_warm_glow_of_mayberry/|accessdate=July 4, 2012|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=November 11, 2003|location=Boston, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; with strong ratings.&lt;ref name=2003-reunion-b&gt;{{cite news|last=Thomas|first=George M.|title=Ron Howard says 'The Missing' compels with story, performances|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/celebrity/articles/2003/11/28/ron_howard_says_the_missing_compels_with_story_performances/|accessdate=July 4, 2012|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=November 28, 2003|location=Boston, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Matlock'' (1986–1995)====
After leaving his still-popular show in 1968, and starting his own production company (Andy Griffith Enterprises) in 1972, Griffith starred in less-successful television series such as ''[[The Headmaster (TV series)|Headmaster]]'' (1970), ''[[The New Andy Griffith Show]]'' (1971), ''[[Adams of Eagle Lake]]'' (1975), ''[[Salvage 1]]'' (1979) and ''The Yeagers'' (1980).

After spending seven months in rehabilitation for leg [[paralysis]] from [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]] in 1983, Griffith returned to television as the title character, Ben Matlock, in the legal drama ''[[Matlock (TV series)|Matlock]]'' (1986–1995) on NBC and ABC. Matlock was a [[country lawyer]] in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, who was known for his [[Southern American English|Southern drawl]] and for always winning his cases. ''Matlock'' also starred unfamiliar, struggling actors (both of whom were childhood fans of Andy Griffith) [[Nancy Stafford]] as Michelle Thomas (1987–1992) and [[Clarence Gilyard]], Jr. as Conrad McMasters (1989–1993). By the end of its first season it was a ratings powerhouse on Tuesday nights. Although the show was nominated for four Emmy Awards, Griffith once again was never nominated. He did, however, win a People's Choice Award in 1987 for his work as Matlock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peopleschoice.com/pca/awards/nominees/index.jsp?year=1987 |title=People's Choice Awards 1987 |accessdate=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other television appearances====
Griffith also made other character appearances through the years on ''[[Playhouse 90]]'', ''[[Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.]]'', ''[[The Mod Squad]]'', ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[The Doris Day Show]]'', ''[[Here's Lucy]]'', ''[[The Bionic Woman]]'' and ''[[Fantasy Island]]'', among many others. He also reprised his role as Ben Matlock on ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]'' in 1997, and his final guest-starring role was in 2001 in an episode of ''[[Dawson's Creek]]''.

===Films (including television films)===
For most of the 1970s, Griffith starred or appeared in many television films, including ''[[The Strangers In 7A]]'' (1972), ''[[Go Ask Alice]]'' (1973), ''[[Winter Kill]]'' (1974) and ''[[Pray for the Wildcats]]'' (1974), which marked his first villainous role since ''A Face in the Crowd''. Griffith appeared again as a villain in ''[[Savages (1974 film)|Savages]]'' (1974), a television film based on the novel ''[[Deathwatch (book)|Deathwatch]]'' (1972) by [[Robb White]]. Griffith received his only [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nomination as [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor – Miniseries or a Movie|Outstanding Supporting Actor – Miniseries or a Movie]] for his role as the father of a murder victim in the television film ''[[Murder in Texas]]'' (1981) and won further acclaim for his role as a [[homicide|homicidal]] [[villain]] in the television film ''[[Murder in Coweta County]]'' (1983), co-starring music legend [[Johnny Cash]] as the sheriff. He also appeared in several [[miniseries|television miniseries]], including the television version of ''[[From Here to Eternity (TV series)|From Here to Eternity]]'' (1979), ''[[Roots: The Next Generations]]'' (1979), ''[[Centennial (miniseries)|Centennial]]'' (1978), and the [[Watergate scandal]]-inspired ''[[The Company (Ehrlichman novel)|Washington: Behind Closed Doors]]'' (1977), playing a former president loosely based on [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].

Most of the television movies in which Griffith starred were also attempts to launch a new series. ''[[Winter Kill]]'' (1974) launched the short-lived ''[[Adams of Eagle Lake]]'', which was canceled in 1975 after only two episodes. A year later, he starred as a New York City attorney for the DA's office in ''Street Killing'', which also failed to launch a new show. Two television films for NBC in 1977, ''The Girl in the Empty Grave'' and ''Deadly Game'', were attempts for Griffith to launch a new series featuring him as Police Chief Abel Marsh, a more hard-edged version of Andy Taylor; despite strong ratings, both were unsuccessful in leading to a new TV show.

While appearing in television films and guest roles on television series over the next 10 years, Griffith also appeared in two feature films, both of which flopped at the box office. He co-starred with [[Jeff Bridges]] as a crusty old 1930s western actor in the comedy ''[[Hearts of the West (1975 film)|Hearts of the West]]'' (1975), and he appeared alongside [[Tom Berenger]] as a gay villainous [[colonel]] and cattle baron in the Western comedy spoof ''[[Rustlers' Rhapsody]]'' (1985).

He also appeared as an attorney in the NBC miniseries ''[[Fatal Vision (miniseries)|Fatal Vision]]'' (1984), which is considered a precursor to his role in ''Matlock''.

Griffith stunned many unfamiliar with his ''A Face in the Crowd'' work in the television film ''Crime of Innocence'' (1985), where he portrayed a callous judge who routinely sentenced juveniles to hard prison time. Also noteworthy in Griffith's darker roles was his character in ''Under the Influence'' (1986), a TV-movie where Griffith played an alcoholic, abusive patriarch. He further surprised audiences with his role as a dangerous and mysterious grandfather in the television film ''Gramps'' (1995) co-starring [[John Ritter]]. He also appeared as a comical villain in the spy movie spoof ''[[Spy Hard]]'' (1996) starring [[Leslie Nielsen]]. In the television film ''[[A Holiday Romance]]'' (1999), Griffith played the role of Jake Peterson. In the film ''[[Daddy and Them]]'' (2001), Griffith portrayed a patriarch of a dysfunctional southern family.

In the feature film ''[[Waitress (2007 film)|Waitress]]'' (2007), Griffith played a crusty [[diner]] owner who takes a shine to [[Keri Russell]]'s character. His last appearance was the leading role in the [[romantic comedy]], [[independent film]] ''[[Play the Game (2009 film)|Play the Game]]'' (2009) as a lonely, widowed grandfather re-entering the dating world after a 60-year hiatus. The cast of ''Play the Game'' also included [[Rance Howard]], Ron Howard's real-life father, who had made appearances in various supporting roles on ''The Andy Griffith Show'', and [[Clint Howard]], Ron's younger brother, who had the recurring role of Leon (the kid offering the ice cream cone or peanut butter sandwich) on ''The Andy Griffith Show''.

===Singing and recording career===
Griffith sang as part of some of his acting roles, most notably in ''A Face in the Crowd'' and in many episodes of both ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' and ''[[Matlock (TV series)|Matlock]]''. In addition to his recordings of comic monologues in the 1950s, he made an album of upbeat country and gospel tunes during the run of ''The Andy Griffith Show'', which included a version of the show's theme sung by Griffith under the title "[[The Fishin' Hole]]".

===Name dispute===
William Harold Fenrick of [[Platteville, Wisconsin]], legally changed his name to Andrew Jackson Griffith and ran unsuccessfully for sheriff of [[Grant County, Wisconsin|Grant County]] in November 2006. Subsequently, actor Griffith filed a lawsuit against Griffith/Fenrick, asserting that he violated [[Intellectual property|trademark, copyright]], and [[Privacy law|privacy]] laws by changing his name for the "sole purpose of taking advantage of Griffith's fame in an attempt to gain votes." On May 4, 2007, [[United States District Court|US District Court]] [[Judge]] [[John C. Shabaz]] ruled that Griffith/Fenrick did not violate [[Law of the United States|federal]] trademark law because he did not use the Griffith name in a commercial transaction but instead in order "to seek elective office, fundamental First Amendment protected speech."&lt;ref name=name_weau&gt;{{cite web|title=Andy Griffith Sues Former Wisconsin Sheriff's Candidate|url=http://www.weau.com/home/headlines/4621396.html|publisher=WEAU.com|accessdate=April 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Foley|first=Ryan J.|title=Judge: Candidate named after Andy Griffith didn't harm actor|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qmpPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yyUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3999,1672548&amp;dq=william+harold+fenrick&amp;hl=en|accessdate=July 4, 2012|newspaper=The Times-News|date=May 8, 2007|agency=The Associated Press|location=Hendersonville, NC|page=4C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ron Howard===
[[File:Andy Griffith Ron Howard Andy Griffith Show 1961.JPG|thumb|Griffith posing with a young Ron Howard in a publicity photo for ''The Andy Griffith Show'' (1961)]]
Griffith's friendship with the then-unknown [[Ron Howard]] began in 1960, when they guest-starred in the episode of ''Make Room For Daddy'' that led to the formation of ''The Andy Griffith Show'' the same year. For eight seasons, they starred together in most of the show's episodes, portraying father and son.

They guest-starred together in the show's [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series, ''Mayberry R.F.D.''. They appeared in an episode where Griffith's character married his long-time girlfriend, Helen Crump,{{cn|date=July 2018}} and in the ''Gomer Pyle U.S.M.C.'' episode "Opie Joins the Marines", in which Howard's character, Opie, runs away from home and attempts to enlist in the [[United States Marine Corps|US Marines]].{{cn|date=July 2018}} They co-starred in the TV special ''Return to Mayberry'' (1986), in which the now-adult Opie is about to become a father. They later appeared together in CBS reunion specials in 1993&lt;ref name=1993reunion /&gt; and 2003.&lt;ref name=2003-reunion-a /&gt;&lt;ref name=2003-reunion-b /&gt;

In October 2008, Griffith and Howard briefly reprised their Mayberry roles in an [[video clip|online video]] ''Ron Howard's Call to Action''. It was posted to comedy video website [[Funny or Die]]. The video encouraged people to vote and endorsed [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidates [[Barack Obama]] and [[Joe Biden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ron Howard's Call To Action|url=http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/cc65ed650d/ron-howards-call-to-action-from-ron-howard-and-henry-winkler|publisher=FunnyorDie.com|accessdate=July 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Opie and Andy stump for Obama in video |url=http://www.news-record.com/content/2008/10/24/article/opie_and_andy_on_obama_stump_for_obama_in_video |accessdate=July 3, 2012 |newspaper=News &amp; Record |date=October 24, 2008 |location=Greensboro, NC }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Griffith's death, Howard stated: "His love of creating, the joy he took in it whether it was drama or comedy or his music, was inspiring to grow up around. The spirit he created on the set of ''The Andy Griffith Show'' was joyful and professional all at once. It was an amazing environment. And I think it was a reflection of the way he felt about having the opportunity to create something that people could enjoy. It was always with respect and passion for the opportunity and really what it could offer people in a very unpretentious and earthy way. He felt he was always working in service of an audience he really respected and cared about. He was a great influence on me. His passing is sad. But he lived a great rich life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=NIKKI FINKE, Editor in Chief |url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/07/ron-howard-andy-griffith-remembrance-andy-griffith-show/ |title=EXCLUSIVE: Ron Howard On Andy Griffith |publisher=Deadline.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, 4 years after his TV father's death, he said in a 2016 interview with US Magazine when Griffith would allow the then 7-year-old boy to embark on his own writing, "I felt elated," Howard recalled: "Andy Griffith said, 'What are you grinnin' at, young'un?' I said, 'That’s the first idea of mine they've taken.' He said, 'It’s the first that was any damn good. Now let’s rehearse!'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/ron-howard-didnt-think-tom-hanks-would-get-cast-in-splash-w448948|title=Why Ron Howard Thought Tom Hanks Had ‘No Chance in Hell’ of Landing a Role in ‘Splash’|publisher=US.com|date=November 14, 2016 |accessdate=April 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political activities==
In 2000, Griffith appeared in a last-minute campaign commercial where he endorsed then-Attorney General [[Mike Easley]] for governor of the state of North Carolina. Easley had been locked in a tight race with former Mayor of Charlotte [[Richard Vinroot]] and had been losing his lead in the polls. Easley would [[North Carolina gubernatorial election, 2000|go on to win that November]], taking 52% of the vote to Vinroot's 46%. Many observers dubbed Easley's victory as the "Mayberry Miracle," and credit Griffith's endorsement for stopping his falling poll numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Andy Griffith's political pals|url=http://www.politico.com/gallery/2012/07/andy-griffiths-political-pals/000244-003111.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

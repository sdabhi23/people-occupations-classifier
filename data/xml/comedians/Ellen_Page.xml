==Career==
[[Image:Ellen Page.jpg|thumb|upright|Page in 2007]]
Page first acted in front of the camera in 1997 at age ten in the [[CBC Television|CBC television]] movie ''Pit Pony'', which later spun off into a television series. This led to more roles in several small Canadian films (including ''[[Marion Bridge (film)|Marion Bridge]]'', her first feature film role) and in television series, notably playing Treena Lahey in season two of ''[[Trailer Park Boys]]''. At 16, she was cast in ''[[Mouth to Mouth (2005 British film)|Mouth to Mouth]]'', an independent film shot in Europe. Page starred in the 2005 movie ''[[Hard Candy (film)|Hard Candy]]'' as a young girl who takes a [[pedophile]] hostage, and won praise for "one of the most complex, disturbing and haunting performances of the year."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Claudia |last=Puig |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2006-12-21-kid-oscars-ellen_x.htm |title=Ellen: Manipulates ''Hard Candy'' to great effect |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|location=Mclean, Virginia|date=December 22, 2006 |accessdate=July 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Page appeared in ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=CfK0KtPpSgcC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;lpg=PA85&amp;dq=ellen+page+role+in+Xmen+the+last+stand&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=j7AiCE-eEk&amp;sig=KJ9cpTYnz_AYPuq_iet4TeIprIg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwifg93stbvWAhWG5iYKHftBAt44ChDoAQhXMAw#v=onepage&amp;q=ellen%20page%20role%20in%20Xmen%20the%20last%20stand&amp;f=false|title=The 21st Century Superhero: Essays on Gender, Genre and Globalization in Film|first1=Richard J.

In the previous X-Men movies, the part had been used in brief cameos played by other actresses, but never as a main character. Page was nominated for the [[Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Scene Stealer]] for the role.

Page portrayed the title character in the 2007 film ''[[Juno (film)|Juno]]''. Film critic [[A. O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described her as "frighteningly talented"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=A.O.|last=Scott|authorlink=A.O.

The role, however, did win her more than 20 awards, including a [[Canadian Comedy Awards|Canadian Comedy Award]], an [[Independent Spirit Award]], and a [[Satellite Award]] besides the likes of numerous Critics awards including [[Detroit Film Critics Society]], [[Austin Film Critics Association]] and [[Florida Film Critics Circle]].

Page also co-starred in ''[[Smart People]]'', which premiered at the 2008 [[Sundance Film Festival]]. Shot before ''Juno'', but released afterwards, the film saw her playing overachieving daughter to [[Dennis Quaid]]{{'s}} college professor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video|people=Noam Muro |title=Smart People |medium=dvd |publisher=Mirmax |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Page's other film credits include ''[[An American Crime]]'', which premiered at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival; ''[[The Tracey Fragments (film)|The Tracey Fragments]]'', which was released in November 2007 in Canada and May 2008 in the US; and ''[[The Stone Angel (film)|The Stone Angel]]''.

As of 2010, she serves as a spokesperson for [[Cisco Systems]] in a series of advertisements, appearing in three commercials set in [[Lunenburg, Nova Scotia]].

'''Edgar Livingston Kennedy''' (April 26, 1890 &amp;ndash; November 9, 1948) was an American comedic [[film]] [[character actor]], known as "Slow Burn".&lt;ref name=eveind/&gt;&lt;ref name=heffernan&gt;{{cite news |title=Edgar Kennedy Charges Film Heroes Steal His Stuff|first=Harold |last=Heffernan |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SB9kAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PnsNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1415,3531432&amp;dq=edgar+kennedy&amp;hl=en |newspaper=The Calgary Herald |date=3 October 1939 |accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A slow burn is an exasperated facial expression, performed very deliberately; Kennedy embellished this by rubbing his hand over his bald head and across his face, in an attempt to hold his temper. Kennedy is best known for a small role as a [[lemonade]] vendor in the [[Marx Brothers]] film ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'', as well as the many [[Hal Roach]] films he appeared in.

==Early years==
Kennedy was born on April 26, 1890, in [[Monterey County, California]], to [[Canadians]] Neil Kennedy and Annie Quinn. He attended [[San Rafael High School]] before taking up boxing.&lt;ref name=stpetetimes&gt;{{cite news |title=Edgar Kennedy, Film Actor, Dies |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FFtIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LE4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2082,3924629&amp;dq=edgar+kennedy&amp;hl=en |newspaper=St. Petersburg Times |date=10 Nov 1948 |accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=swenson&gt;{{cite news |title=Movie Funny Man Declares He's Really Serious Fellow |first=Bette |last=Swenson |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DEdPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0U4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4853,3228340&amp;dq=edgar+kennedy&amp;hl=en |newspaper=St. Petersburg Times |date=24 May 1945 |accessdate=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a [[light-heavyweight]] and once went 14 rounds with [[Jack Dempsey]]. After [[boxing]], he worked as a [[singer]] in [[vaudeville]], [[musical comedy]] and [[light opera]].&lt;ref name=stpetetimes/&gt;

==Film career==
Making his debut in 1911,&lt;ref name=stpetetimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=pittpress/&gt; Kennedy appeared in about 500 films,&lt;ref name=stpetetimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=pittpress&gt;{{cite news |title=Actor Edgar Kennedy Dies of Throat Cancer |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MngbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ME0EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3614,3805072&amp;dq=edgar+kennedy&amp;hl=en |newspaper=The Pittsburg Press |date=10 Nov 1948 |accessdate=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; working with some of the biggest film comedians in the United States, including [[Fatty Arbuckle|Roscoe Arbuckle]], [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Laurel and Hardy]], the [[Marx Brothers]], [[Charley Chase]], and the ''[[Our Gang]]'' series. He was also one of the original [[Keystone Kops]].

Kennedy's burly frame originally suited him for villainous or threatening roles in silent pictures. By the 1920s Kennedy was working for producer [[Hal Roach]], who kept the actor busy playing supporting roles in short comedies. Kennedy starred in one short, ''A Pair of Tights'' (1928), in which he plays a tightwad determined to spend as little as possible on a date. His antics with comedian [[Stuart Erwin]] are reminiscent of Roach's Laurel and Hardy comedies, produced concurrently. Roach also used Kennedy as a director on half a dozen two-reeler comedies.

In 1930, Edgar Kennedy was featured by RKO-Pathe in a pair of short-subject comedies, ''Next Door Neighbors'' and ''Help Wanted, Female''. Kennedy's characterization of a short-tempered householder was so effective that RKO built a series around it. The "Average Man" comedies starred Kennedy as a blustery, stubborn guy determined to accomplish a household project or get ahead professionally, despite the meddling of his featherbrained wife (usually [[Florence Lake]]), her freeloading brother (originally William Eugene, then [[Jack Rice]]) and his dubious mother-in-law ([[Dot Farley]]). Kennedy pioneered the kind of domestic [[situation comedy]] that later became familiar on television. Each installment would end with Edgar embarrassed, humbled or defeated, looking at the camera and doing his patented slow burn. ''The Edgar Kennedy Series'', with its theme song "[[Chopsticks (music)|Chopsticks]]", became a standard part of the movie-going experience: Kennedy made six "Average Man" shorts a year for 17 years. In 1938, Kennedy worked as a straight man for British comedian [[Will Hay]] in ''[[Hey! Hey! USA]]''.

Kennedy became so identified with frustration that practically every studio hired him to play hotheads. He often played dumb cops, detectives, and even a prison warden; sometimes he was a grouchy moving man, truck driver, or blue-collar workman. His character usually lost his temper at least once. In ''Diplomaniacs'', Kennedy presides over an international tribunal, where [[Wheeler &amp; Woolsey]] want to do something about world peace. "Well, ya can't do anything about it {{em|here}}", yells Kennedy, "this is a {{em|peace conference!}}" Kennedy, established as the [[poster boy]] for frustration, even starred in an instructional film titled ''The Other Fellow'', in which loudmouthed roadhog Edgar always vents his anger on other drivers (each one played by Kennedy as well), little realizing that, to them, {{em|he}} is "the other fellow."&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|ngm3W6k-bVk|Edgar Kennedy in "The Other Fellow,"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps his most unusual roles were as a puppeteer in the detective mystery ''[[The Falcon Strikes Back]]'' and as a philosophical bartender inspired to create exotic cocktails in [[Harold Lloyd]]'s last film, ''[[The Sin of Harold Diddlebock]]'' (1947). He also played comical detectives opposite two titans of acting: [[John Barrymore]] in ''[[Twentieth Century (film)|Twentieth Century]]'' (1934) and [[Rex Harrison]] in ''[[Unfaithfully Yours (1948 film)|Unfaithfully Yours]]'' (1948); in the latter, he tells conductor Harrison that "Nobody handles Handel like you handle Handel."

==Death==
Kennedy died of [[Esophageal cancer|throat cancer]] at the [[Motion Picture Hospital]], [[San Fernando Valley]] on 9 November 1948.&lt;ref name=pittpress/&gt;&lt;ref name=heraldj&gt;{{cite news |title=Edgar Kennedy Dies |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UV0sAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=J8sEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1923,884478&amp;dq=edgar+kennedy&amp;hl=en |newspaper=Herald-Journal |date=10 Nov 1948 |accessdate=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His body was interred at the [[Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City]], [[Los Angeles County, California]].

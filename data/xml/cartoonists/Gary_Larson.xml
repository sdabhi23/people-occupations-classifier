'''Gary Larson''' (born August 14, 1950) is an American cartoonist. He is the creator of ''[[The Far Side]]'', a single-panel cartoon series that was syndicated internationally to over 1,900 newspapers for fifteen years.&lt;ref name=wild/&gt; The series ended with Larson's retirement on January 1, 1995. His twenty-three books of collected cartoons have combined sales of more than forty-five million copies.&lt;ref name=wild/&gt;

==Early life and education==
Larson was born and raised in [[University Place, Washington]], in suburban [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]],&lt;ref name=wild /&gt; the son of Verner, a [[car salesman]], and Doris, a [[secretary]].&lt;ref name=walk/&gt; He graduated from [[Curtis Senior High School]] in University Place and from [[Washington State University]] in [[Pullman, Washington|Pullman]]&lt;ref name=wild /&gt; with a degree in communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|last1=Angier|first1=Natalie|title=An Amateur of Biology Returns to His Easel|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/28/science/aficionado-of-science-gary-larson-an-amateur-of-biology-returns-to-his-easel.html|work=The New York Times|date=28 April 1998|page=F5|department=Science Times|volume=147|issue=51,141}}&lt;/ref&gt; During high school and college, he played jazz guitar&lt;ref name=Salon99 /&gt; and banjo.&lt;ref name=wild /&gt;

Larson said his family has "a morbid sense of humor",&lt;ref name=wild /&gt; and that he was influenced by the "paranoid" sense of humor of his older brother, Dan.&lt;ref name=walk&gt;[http://mentalfloss.com/article/17358/50-reasons-subscribe-mentalfloss-45-gary-larson Ferguson, Kelly. "A Walk on the Far Side: The Life and Times of Gary Larson." 2006. ''Mental_Floss'' Nov.-Dec. 2006, 59-65.]&lt;/ref&gt; Dan played [[prank]]s on Gary, for example by taking advantage of his fear of monsters under the bed by waiting in the closet for the right moment to pounce. Dan "scared the hell out of me" whenever he could,&lt;ref name=wild /&gt; Gary said, but Dan also nurtured Gary's love of scientific knowledge. They caught animals in [[Puget Sound]] and placed them in [[terrarium]]s in the basement, and also made a small desert ecosystem.&lt;ref name=walk/&gt;

==Career==

===Early cartoon work===
According to Larson in his anthology ''[[The Prehistory of The Far Side]]'',&lt;ref name=prehistory&gt;Larson, Gary. ''The Prehistory of the Far Side: a 10th anniversary exhibit''. Kansas City, MO: Andrew and McNeel, 1989. {{ISBN|0-8362-1851-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was working in a music store&lt;ref name=Salon99 /&gt; when he took a few days off, after finally realizing how much he hated his job. During that time, he decided to try cartooning. In 1976, he drew six cartoons and submitted them to ''Pacific Search'' (afterwards ''Pacific Northwest Magazine''), a [[Seattle]]-based magazine.&lt;ref name=Salon99 /&gt; After contributing to another local Seattle paper, in 1979 Larson submitted his work to ''[[The Seattle Times]]''. Under the title ''[[Nature's Way]]'', his work was published weekly next to the ''Junior Jumble''.&lt;ref name=prehistory /&gt;

To supplement his income, Larson worked for the [[Humane Society]] as a cruelty investigator.&lt;ref name=wild /&gt;

===''The Far Side''===
{{Main article|The Far Side}}
Larson decided that he could increase his income from cartooning by selling his ''Nature's Way'' strip to another newspaper. While on vacation in [[San Francisco]], he pitched his work to the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' and, to his surprise, the ''Chronicle'' bought the strip and promoted it for [[Print syndication|syndication]], renaming it ''The Far Side''.&lt;ref name=Salon99 /&gt; Its first appearance in the ''Chronicle'' was on January 1, 1980.  A week later, ''The Seattle Times'' dropped ''Nature’s Way.''&lt;ref name=prehistory /&gt; ''The Far Side'' ran for fifteen years, syndicated initially by [[Chronicle Features]] and later by [[Universal Press Syndicate]], until Larson retired with his final strip published on January 1, 1995.

Themes in ''The Far Side'' were often [[Surreal humour|surreal]], such as "How cows behave when no human watches" or "The unexpected dangers of being an insect." Often, the behavior of supposedly superior humans was compared with animals. For instance, a father explains to his son that a bird song is a territorial marking common to the lower animals, while surrounded by fences and dense housing. Animals and other creatures were frequently presented [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphically]]. One strip depicts a family of spiders driving in a car with a "Have a Nice Day" bumper sticker, featuring a "smiley face" with eight eyes.

One of Larson's more famous cartoons shows a [[chimpanzee]] couple grooming. The female finds a blonde human hair on the male and inquires, "Conducting a little more 'research' with that [[Jane Goodall]] tramp?" A representative from the [[Jane Goodall Institute]] thought that this was in bad taste and wrote a critical letter to Larson regarding the cartoon.  Larson contacted the Goodall Institute to apologize only to find that Jane Goodall herself, who was in Africa at the time of the cartoon's publication and only learned of it years after its initial publication, approved of it, stating that she found it amusing. Since then, all profits from sales of a shirt featuring this cartoon go to the Goodall Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n5eIBwAAQBAJ | title=Make 'em Laugh! American Humorists of the 20th and 21st Centuries | publisher=ABC-CLIO | author=Jarvis, Zeke | year=2015 | pages=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goodall wrote a preface to ''The Far Side Gallery 5'', detailing her version of the "Jane Goodall Tramp" controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, Gary. ''The Far Side Gallery 5''. Kansas City, Missouri: Andrew and McNeel, 1995. {{ISBN|0-8362-0425-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; She praised Larson's creative ideas, which often compare and contrast the behavior of humans and animals. In 1988, Larson visited [[Gombe Stream National Park]] and was attacked by [[Kasakela_Chimpanzee_Community#Frodo|Frodo]], a chimp described by Goodall as a "bully". Larson sustained cuts and bruises from the encounter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Hartley |first=Aiden |title=Me rodo, you Jane |journal=The Spectator |date=2002-06-29|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_200206/ai_n9130751/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113105048/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_200206/ai_n9130751/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Larson's ''Far Side'' cartoons were syndicated worldwide and published in many collections. They were also reproduced extensively on [[greeting cards]] which were very popular, but these were discontinued in March 2009. Two animated versions were produced for television: ''[[Gary Larson's Tales from the Far Side|Tales from the Far Side]]'' (1994) and ''Tales from the Far Side II'' (1997).&lt;ref name=Salon99 /&gt;&lt;ref name=IMDB&gt;{{IMDb name|id=488989}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 ''Far Side'' calendar donated all author royalties to [[Conservation International]].&lt;ref name=wild&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/2006-11-20-larson-cover-usat_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Larson drawn to wild side | first=Elizabeth | last=Weise | date=November 22, 2006 | accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Retirement ===
By late-1994, Larson thought the series was getting repetitive and did not want to enter what he called the "Graveyard of Mediocre Cartoons."&lt;ref name=walk/&gt;&lt;ref name=Salon99 /&gt; He retired the strip on January 1, 1995, when he was 44 years old. Since retiring from ''The Far Side,'' Larson has done occasional cartoon work, including magazine illustrations and promotional artwork for ''Far Side'' merchandise. For the most part, he has also retired from public view: "He refuses to have his picture taken and avoids being on TV," ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine wrote in 2003. To Larson, "cartoonists are expected to be anonymous."&lt;ref&gt;Stein, Joel. [http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,490695,00.html "Life Beyond The Far Side,"] ''Time'' (September 29, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Larson published his first post-''Far Side'' book ''There's a Hair in My Dirt!: A Worm's Story'', an illustrated book with thematic similarities to ''The Far Side''. The short book tells the story of an [[earthworm]] who feels that his life is insignificant. The main plot is told by the young worm's father and follows the beautiful (but slightly dim) human maiden Harriet, who takes a stroll across a woodland trail, encountering different aspects of the ecological world.&lt;ref name=Salon99 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.cnn.com/1998-07-10/entertainment/9807_10_gary.larson_1_larson-is-lowly-worm-humor?_s=PM:books |work=CNN |title=New book rides wave of Viagra jokes |date=July 29, 1998 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002063030/http://articles.cnn.com/1998-07-10/entertainment/9807_10_gary.larson_1_larson-is-lowly-worm-humor?_s=PM%3Abooks |archivedate=October 2, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She admires it but knows little about the land around her, and that eventually leads to her downfall.

The story ends when the young worm realizes that the hair in his dirt is actually a "Harriet" (a hair from the long dead Harriet's body). The story became a [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller]] on May 24, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The New York Times Best Seller List - May 24, 1998 Fiction|url=http://www.hawes.com/1998/1998-05-24.pdf|accessdate=18 February 2011|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 24, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Larson drew a cover for the November 17, 2003, edition of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.newyorker.com/?i=2003-11-17 Online edition of ''The New Yorker'', 17 November 2003], featuring the cover drawn by Larson&lt;/ref&gt; an offer he felt was too prestigious to refuse.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, Rebecca.

Larson voices himself in the ''[[The Simpsons|Simpsons]]'' 2010 episode "[[Once Upon a Time in Springfield]]."

==Awards and honors==
Larson was awarded the Newspaper Panel Cartoon Award by the [[National Cartoonists Society]] in 1985 and 1988. Larson earned the society’s [[Reuben Award]] for 1990 and 1994.

On March 15, 1989, a newly discovered [[insect]] species was named after Larson by [[Dale H. Clayton]], head of the Committee of Evolutionary Biology at the [[University of Chicago]]. The ''[[Strigiphilus garylarsoni]]'' is a chewing [[louse]]&lt;ref name=wild /&gt; of a [[genus]] found only on [[owl]]s. Wrote Larson: "I considered this an extreme honor. Besides, I knew no one was going to write and ask to name a new species of swan after me. You have to grab these opportunities when they come along." An [[Letter (paper size)|8" × 11" (20 × 28 cm)]] magnification of the insect appeared in the ''Prehistory of the Far Side'' 10th anniversary compilation, along with the letter requesting permission to use his name. Similarly, an [[Ecuador]]ian [[rainforest]] butterfly was named after him; ''[[Serratoterga larsoni]]''.&lt;ref name=walk/&gt; The ''Garylarsonus'' beetle carries his name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.curioustaxonomy.net/etym/people.html Curiosities of Biological Nomenclature: Etymologies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=I only see this genus (?) mentioned in list of taxa named after Larson; there should be a source confirming this taxon exists and was formally named, ideally in the Coleoptera literature.|date=September 2017}} The term "[[thagomizer]]", a feature of [[stegosaurus]] anatomy, was coined in a ''Far Side'' cartoon.&lt;ref name=Salon99 /&gt;

== Online presence ==
Since 1999 Larson has objected to his work being displayed on the internet, and has been sending takedown notices to owners of fan websites and users posting his cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.comicmix.com/2008/03/07/gary-larson-and-our-far-side-cease-and-desist/|title=Gary Larson and Our 'Far Side' Cease &amp; Desist {{!}} ComicMix|website=www.comicmix.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a personal letter included with the requests, Larson claimed that his work is too personal and important to him to have others "take control of it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portmann.com/farside/|title=Gary Larson sent me this email|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000829044437/http://www.portmann.com/farside/|archivedate=August 29, 2000|deadurl=yes|accessdate=November 21, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.comicmix.com/2008/03/07/gary-larson-and-our-far-side-cease-and-desist/|title=Gary Larson and Our 'Far Side' Cease &amp; Desist {{!}} ComicMix|website=www.comicmix.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larson has been criticized for not providing a legitimate online source for the ''Far Side'' series and negatively compared to cartoonists who have embraced the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20101230/02545312468/dear-gary-larson-your-kids-go-out-night-let-them-be.shtml|title=Dear Gary Larson: Your Kids Go Out At Night; Let Them Be|work=Techdirt.|access-date=2018-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1987, Larson married Toni Carmichael, an [[anthropologist]].  Early in their relationship, Carmichael became his business manager. "She's my pit bull, but she's a nice one," Larson has said.&lt;ref name=wild /&gt;

In ''The Complete Far Side'',&lt;ref&gt;Larson, Gary. ''The Complete Far Side''. 1st ed. Kansas City, MO: Andrews McNeel, 2003. {{ISBN|0-7407-2113-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larson says that his greatest disappointment in life occurred when he was at a luncheon and sat across from cartoonist [[Charles Addams]], creator of [[The Addams Family]]. Larson was not able to think of a single thing to say to him and deeply regretted the missed opportunity. Addams died in 1988.

Larson is an [[environmentalist]]. "Protecting wildlife is 'at the top of my list', he says."&lt;ref name="wild" /&gt;

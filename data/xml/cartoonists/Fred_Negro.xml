'''Frederick John Negro''' (born 1959) is an Australian [[satirist]], [[musician]], [[songwriter]], and [[cartoonist]]. He has fronted numerous rock, punk and country bands.

==Biography==
Frederick John Negro was born in 1959 and grew up in [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]].&lt;ref name="Donovan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="APRA Cute"/&gt; In 1979 Negro formed a post-punk group, The Editions, on drums with Roz Dear on vocals, John Durr on guitar and David Yob Hoban on bass guitar.&lt;ref name="McFarlaneISoYG"/&gt; By the following year Dear was replaced by [[Sherine Abeyratne]] on vocals.&lt;ref name="McFarlaneISoYG"/&gt; From 1981 to 1982 they issued three cassette albums, ''Aggression'', ''Recession'' and ''Obsession'', on their own label, Orgasm Records.&lt;ref name="McFarlaneISoYG"/&gt;

Negro left The Editions in 1983 to form punk rockers, I Spit on Your Gravy on vocals and drums.&lt;ref name="McFarlaneISoYG"/&gt; Initial line up included Jason "The Big J" Banner (Australia's 8th best guitarist) on guitar, David Yob Hoban on bass guitar, and Scotti "Stix" Simpson on vocals and drums.&lt;ref name="McFarlaneISoYG"/&gt; Australian musicologist, [[Ian McFarlane]], described their early performances as "shambolic, drunken affairs, replete with on-stage brawls and members barely able to stand upright, let alone play their instruments".&lt;ref name="McFarlaneISoYG"/&gt; Negro was often "dropping his pants in public" and would deliver "other on-stage obscenities".&lt;ref name="McFarlaneISoYG"/&gt;

In February 1985 the group issued their debut six-track extended play, ''St Kilda's Alright'', which they co-produced with Paul Elliott for Man Made Records at York Street Studios.&lt;ref name="McFarlaneISoYG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="St Kilda"/&gt; It included a ten-page booklet, "Suck This Fred Nile", that local police declared was "obscene" and confiscated all available copies due to Negro's "debauched" cartoons and photocopied pornographic images.&lt;ref name="McFarlaneISoYG"/&gt; As for the music itself, McFarlane declares it was "desperately inept and sounded like it had been recorded at the bottom of a dam".&lt;ref name="McFarlaneISoYG"/&gt;

Also in 1985 Phil "Grizzly" Miles joined I Spit on Your Gravy on rhythm guitar and vocals.&lt;ref name="McFarlaneISoYG"/&gt; They issued a studio album, ''Fruit Loop City'', in June 1987, which was co-produced by Miles and Peter "Poyt" Walker for [[Virgin Records]].&lt;ref name="McFarlaneISoYG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fruit Loop"/&gt; They disbanded in the next year, Negro and Miles promptly formed Gravybillies, as a country music, spoof band.&lt;ref name="McFarlaneISoYG"/&gt;

Late in 1987 Negro and Miles formed a rock group, The Band Who Shot Liberty Valance, with Phil "Good-One" Bryant on drums and Trevor Pennington on bass guitar (both ex-Corpse Grinders); and Terry Fosters on harmonica.&lt;ref name="McFarlaneTBWSLV"/&gt; McFarlane described this group as "lager louts [who] were the ultimate charmless, inner-city party band".&lt;ref name="McFarlaneTBWSLV"/&gt; In October 1988 they issued an album, ''Outlaw Death Lager Drinkers from Hell'', on Virgin Records.&lt;ref name="McFarlaneTBWSLV"/&gt; This group broke up in 1989; Negro and Fosters formed The Brady Bunch Lawnmower Massacre, which "continued the drunken hillbilly theme".&lt;ref name="McFarlaneTBWSLV"/&gt; The line up included Paul Barnett on bass guitar, Garry Mansfield on guitar; and former bandmate, Simpson on drums.&lt;ref name="McFarlaneTBWSLV"/&gt;

In 1988 he formed The Brady Bunch Lawnmower Massacre, a country-punk fusion group with Garry Mansfield (guitar), Paul Barnett (bass), Scotty Simpson (drums) and Terry Foster (guitar, harmonica); they disbanded in 1993. [[Punk rock|Punk]]-influenced [[I Spit On Your Gravy]] had also disbanded by the end of the 1980s but Fred has maintained a significant underground presence in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] with regular appearances in his other bands, and today contributes a weekly 'Pub Strip' to the [[Melbourne]] street press, and until major renovation in 2009 MC'd the long running [[Karaoke]] night at the [http://www.ghhotel.com.au/ Greyhound Hotel], [[St Kilda, Victoria]].

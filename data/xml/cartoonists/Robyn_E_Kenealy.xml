'''Robyn E. Kenealy''' (born 1983)&lt;ref name="EarthsEnd"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinnaird|first=Adrian|title=From Earth's End: The Best of New Zealand Comics|year=2013|publisher=Random House|location=Auckland, New Zealand|isbn=978-1-86979-995-3|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[comic book]] artist and organiser in the [[New Zealand]] art communities. She is based in [[Wellington]], and had a role in establishing the '''91 Aro St Gallery''',&lt;ref name="Aro St"/&gt; organising the '''New Zealand Comics Weekend'''&lt;ref name="Salient Magazine"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.salient.org.nz/news/calling-all-geeks%E2%80%A6|title=Salient Article on Comics Weekend 2006|accessdate=2009-05-10|work=Salient Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the '''Eric Awards'''.&lt;ref name="Kiwi Comics"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.comics.org.nz/wiki/index.php?title=Eric_Awards |title=History of the Eric Awards |accessdate=2009-02-11 |work=Kiwi Comics Website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015052536/http://www.comics.org.nz/wiki/index.php?title=Eric_Awards |archivedate=15 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kenealy's early works, ''Influenza in Wellington'' and ''Love Ain't Easy'', were predominantly [[autobiographical comics]]. Her later work ''Roddy's Film Companion'' (a [[biography]] of the film actor [[Roddy McDowall]]) marks a distinct shift from this style. Although ''Roddy's Film Companion'' is biographical, it is also fictional and frequently acknowledges the limitations of 'truth' and 'fact' in historical research. These themes are continued in ''Steve Rogers' American Captain'', an autobiographical comic told from the perspective of [[Captain America|Captain America's]] alter-ego.&lt;ref name=SRACabout&gt;{{cite web|last=Kenealy |first=Robyn |title=Steve Rogers' American Captain |url=http://americancaptaincomic.tumblr.com/about |work=Steve Rogers' American Captain |accessdate=2 November 2016 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413053025/http://americancaptaincomic.tumblr.com/about |archivedate=13 April 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roddy's Film Companion==
From 2005 to 2011 Kenealy produced Roddy's Film Companion, a semi-fictional/biographical comic about the life of the actor [[Roddy McDowall]], whose most well-known role was playing [[List of Planet of the Apes characters#Cornelius|Cornelius]] in ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]''. [[Richard Burton]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Joseph Mankiewicz]] and [[Darryl Zanuck]] also feature in the comics. However, ''Roddy's Film Companion'' is not so much concerned with presenting an accurate portrait of Roddy McDowall's life, but rather with interrogating the limits of 'truth' and 'reality' in biographies through fictionalisation. As Kenealy writes on her website, "Roddy's Film Companion is a one half [[fiction|semi-fictional]] [[biography]] comic of [[child actor|child star]] cum character actor Roddy McDowall (whom you might remember from such films as ''[[How Green Was My Valley (film)|How Green Was My Valley]]'' and ''Planet of the Apes'') and one half a musing on the phenomenon of celebrity itself, as applied to both author and subject."&lt;ref name="Roddy's Film Companion"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wayfarergallery.net/roddysfilmcompanion/|title=Roddy's Film Companion|accessdate=2009-02-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514094817/http://www.wayfarergallery.net/roddysfilmcompanion/|archivedate=14 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue, released in 2006, is set while Roddy was filming the Darryl Zanuck production of ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]''. In late 2008 she started uploading Roddy's Film Companion to the internet.

Kenealy won the award for the best cartoon in the 2009 [[Aotearoa Student Press Association|ASPA]] awards with ''The Darkroom'' weekly serial (a backstory to ''Roddy's Film Companion'') which appeared in [[Salient (magazine)|Salient Magazine]]. [[Dylan Horrocks]], one of the judges, wrote that Kenealy's comics have "all kinds of smarts going on just below the surface."&lt;ref name="ASPA"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/CU0909/S00167.htm|title=2009 ASPA Awards Results|accessdate=2009-01-10|work=Scoop Independent News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tim Bollinger wrote that ''The Darkroom'' has "smart conversational language and pen-and-ink-wash visual narrative."&lt;ref name="Comic Reviews"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://werewolf.co.nz/2009/09/reviews-commentary-etc/|title=Local Comix Newz|accessdate=2009-01-10|work=Werewolf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Steve Rogers' American Captain==
''Steve Rogers' American Captain'' is an autobiographical comic told from the perspective of Captain America's alter-ego, Steve Rogers. Its title is a reference to [[American Splendor]] and [[James Kochalka#American Elf|American Elf]]. Additional story and character development is provided by Johanna Freeman and Ross Sélavy Brighton.&lt;ref name=SRACabout/&gt; It has been featured in [[New York (magazine)|New York magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Lisa|title=Making Hollywood at Home|journal=New York|date=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts organiser==
Kenealy and her husband Richard (Dick) Whyte curate the ongoing art collection '''The Wayfarer Gallery''' based in Wellington's Wayfarer Library, archiving Wellington experimental art. It currently owns more than 200 works from artists such as Rick Jensen, GCR, Brent Willis, Tao Wells, Mark Whyte, Smiley, Sam Stephens, and many others.&lt;ref name="Wayfarer Gallery"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wayfarergallery.net/wayfarergallery/|title=Wayfarer Gallery|accessdate=2009-02-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723130234/http://www.wayfarergallery.net/wayfarergallery/|archivedate=23 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 they collaborated with others to open the '''91 Aro Street Gallery''', another Wellington outlet for independent arts.&lt;ref name="Aro St"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://postmoderncore.com/aroarts/ |title=Aro Street Archive |accessdate=2009-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209103642/http://postmoderncore.com/aroarts/ |archivedate=9 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 91 Aro Street sold and exhibited comics, cassette tapes, CDs, books, films, paintings, photographs, pictures, glass work from New Zealand experimental artists. It was open for twelve months while they held the lease on the premises and held more than 20 exhibitions.

It was during 2005 that 91 Aro St was the venue for the first '''New Zealand Comics Weekend''', a weekend devoted to the exhibition and celebration of New Zealand comics.&lt;ref name="Aro St2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.comics.org.nz/wiki/index.php?title=New_Zealand_Comics_Weekend|title=Robyn Kenealy and others organise New Zealand Comics Weekend|accessdate=2008-02-07|work=New Zealand Comics - Comics.org.nz|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014194127/http://www.comics.org.nz/wiki/index.php?title=New_Zealand_Comics_Weekend|archivedate=14 October 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then Kenealy has been the major organiser of this event in 2006&lt;ref name="Salient Magazine2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.salient.org.nz/news/calling-all-geeks%E2%80%A6|title=Calling All Geeks|accessdate=2009-05-10|work=Salient Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contributed to the 2007 event, organised by cartoonists DRAW and Tim Bollinger.&lt;ref name="TV3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tv3.co.nz/default.aspx?tabid=112&amp;articleID=25484#vidlist25484|title=New Zealand Comics Weekend on TV3|accessdate=2008-02-07|work=TV3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 event also included the Eric Awards, an independently judged New Zealand comic awards. Robyn and Dick hosted the event, which also featured stand-up comedian [[Darren Schroeder]] as the MC.&lt;ref name="Erics"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://isaacfreeman.livejournal.com/205844.html |title=New Zealand Comics Weekend 2006 |accessdate=2008-01-07 |work=Isaac Freeman Livejournal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927085648/http://isaacfreeman.livejournal.com/205844.html |archivedate=27 September 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Kenealy organized the 5th '''New Zealand Comics Weekend''' at The Basement Gallery in Wellington, New Zealand (with the help of DRAW, Claire Harris and Tim Bollinger).&lt;ref name="Comics Weekend 2010"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/local/the-wellingtonian/3465192/a-comical-look-at-life?title=New_Zealand_Comics_Weekend_2010 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130223001120/http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/local/the-wellingtonian/3465192/a-comical-look-at-life?title=New_Zealand_Comics_Weekend_2010 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 February 2013 |title=A Comical Look at Life |accessdate=2010-05-24 |work=The Wellingtonian |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Kenealy was the spokesperson for the ''Concerned Citizens'' exhibition and art event, which raised funds and awareness for those arrested in the [[2007 New Zealand raids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iti to open 'terror raid' exhibition|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/arts/2928546/Iti-to-open-terror-raid-exhibition|accessdate=8 December 2013|newspaper=Stuff.co.nz|date=3 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contained work by many artists including [[Tame Iti]], [[Birchville Cat Motel|Campbell Kneale]], and Kenealy herself;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Concerned Citizens|url=https://sites.google.com/site/concernedcitizensexhibition/artists|work=Concerned Citizens|accessdate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were auctioned by [[Nándor Tánczos]] and [[John Minto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kenealy|first=Robyn|title=Explosive Expression|url=http://salient.org.nz/arts/visual-arts/explosive-expression|accessdate=8 December 2013|newspaper=Salient|date=12  October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

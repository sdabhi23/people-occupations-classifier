'''Murray Hone Ball''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|ONZM}} (26 January 1939 – 12 March 2017)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Peters |first=Mark |url=http://gisborneherald.co.nz/localnews/2701213-135/murray-ball-cartoonist-and-shining-star |title=Murray Ball, cartoonist and shining star, dies at |newspaper=[[The Gisborne Herald]] |accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a New Zealand [[cartoonist]] who became known for his ''Stanley the Palaeolithic Hero'' (the longest running cartoon in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine), ''Bruce the Barbarian'', ''All the King's Comrades'' (also in ''Punch'') and the long-running ''[[Footrot Flats]]'' [[comics|comic]] series. In 2002 Ball became an Officer of the [[New Zealand Order of Merit]] (ONZM) for his services as a cartoonist.

==Life and work==
Ball was born in [[Feilding]] in 1939; his father was [[All Black]] rugby player [[Nelson Ball]]. He grew up in New Zealand before spending some years in Australia and South Africa, where he attended [[Parktown Boys' High School]] and finished his education. He played for the Junior All Blacks in 1959 as a first five-eights. As a young man he worked for the [[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|''Dominion'']] newspaper in [[Wellington]] and the ''Manawatu Times'' before becoming a freelance cartoonist and moving to Scotland, where he found work with publishers DC Thomson, of [[Dundee]]. 

He developed his character ''Stanley'' and had it published in the influential English humour-magazine ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]''. ''Stanley the Palaeolithic Hero'' featured a caveman who wore glasses and struggled with the [[Neolithic]] environment. It became the longest-running strip in ''Punch'''s history, and other English and non-English speaking countries syndicated it. Ball continued to contribute to ''Punch'' after returning with his family to New Zealand.

Ball's early cartoons often had political overtones (his mid-70s UK strips included ''[[All the King's Comrades]]'', and he described himself in the introduction to ''[[The Sisterhood (book)|The Sisterhood]]'' (1993) as a socialist. ''Stanley'' often expresses left-wing attitudes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Tributes paid to him included these:&lt;ref name="Herald Obit"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=11816852 | title=Footrot Flats creator Murray Ball dies | work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] | date=13 March 2017 | accessdate=13 March 2017 | author=Nightingale, Melissa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Footrot Flats''==
{{main|Footrot Flats}}
After 1975 Ball wrote several comics in New Zealand (for instance 'Nature Calls'), but it was in 1976 that he first published the strip ''[[Footrot Flats]]'' in Wellington's afternoon newspaper, ''[[The Evening Post (New Zealand)|The Evening Post]]''.  It rapidly led to the demise of his other strips including ''Stanley'', which he was still writing for [[Punch (magazine)|Punch]].

The strip follows the adventures of a working sheep-dog called (if anything) "Dog" or "The Dog" or "@*&amp;#!", his owner Wal Footrot and the other characters, human and animal, that they encounter or associate with. Ball expresses Dog's thoughts in [[Speech bubble|thought-bubble]]s, though he clearly remains "just a dog" (rather than the heavily anthropomorphised creatures sometimes found in other comics or animation). Dog also has alter-egos including "The Grey Ghost" and "The Iron Paw".

Ball's ''Footrot Flats'' has appeared in syndication in international newspapers, and in over 40 published books. ''Footrot Flats'' inspired a stage musical,&lt;ref name="musical"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
and New Zealand's first [[feature length|feature-length]] animated film, ''[[Footrot Flats: The Dog's Tale]]'' (1986).  ''Footrot Flats'' characters include Wal, Dog, Cooch, Cheeky Hobson, Aunt Dolly, Horse, Pongo, Rangi, Charlie, Major, Jess and the Murphy family of Irish and Hunk and Spit.

''Footrot Flats'' features several remarkable traits: its expansive created-universe, complete with ancillary characters, things and places; the fact that the characters slowly but perceptibly age and mature throughout the twenty-year run of the comic; and the gradual encroachment of political themes over the years (particularly environmentalism and gentle parodies of [[feminism]]).

Ball said he has always wanted his cartooning to have an impact. "The heart of a cartoon is the idea, an artist can create a painting, hang it on the wall and be satisfied with what he has achieved even if no-one else sees it. In cartooning, you must get a human reaction to the idea. The task of the cartoonist is to translate his idea into a drawing that will have impact".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inet.net.nz/~waipara.sleepers/murray_ball.htm |title=Murray Ball |website=''Inet.net.nz'' |accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Ball lived with his wife Pam on a rural property in [[Gisborne, New Zealand]]. In an interview on [[Radio New Zealand National]] on 27 January 2016, Pam said that Murray's health was poor for the last six years and that he was suffering from dementia. Longtime friend and collaborator [[Tom Scott (cartoonist)|Tom Scott]] said that on Sunday, 12 March 2017, he had been advised that Ball had died. He is survived by his wife and children.&lt;ref name="death"&gt;{{cite news|title=Footrot Flats creator Murray Ball has died|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/90340548/footrot-flats-creator-murray-ball-has-died|accessdate=12 March 2017|website=''Stuff.co.nz''|date=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bibliography==
In addition to his cartoon collections, Ball wrote and illustrated a number of books:

* ''Fifteen Men on a Dead Man's Chest'', a satirical look at [[Rugby union in New Zealand|New Zealand rugby]]
* ''Migod! It's Bruce the Barbarian''
* ''The People Makers'' (1970)
* ''The Sisterhood'' (1993), a comical, but rather irate, [[masculist]] book, which caused some uproar at the time of publication
* ''The Flowering of Adam Budd'' 
* ''Quentin Hankey: Traitor''
* ''Tarzan, Gene Kelly And Me'' (2001) – approximately, an autobiography.
* ''Fred the (Quite) Brave Mouse''

Ball also wrote a large-format [[Illustrated fiction|illustrated novel]] whose verse parodied the Australian [[bush-ballad]] as popularised by [[Banjo Paterson]] and [[Henry Lawson]]. Titled ''The Ballad of Footrot Flats'', it was published in 1996. Originally intended as a second film script, this work was the first new ''Footrot'' material which Ball had published since 1994. It was the last of the ''Footrot'' series.

==Interests==
Murray Ball and [[Charles M. Schulz]] each admired the other's work. One ''Footrot Flats'' strip shows Dog laughing at a [[Snoopy]] cartoon. Schulz wrote the introduction to the only ''Footrot Flats'' published in the United States (it appeared as ''Footrot Flats'' there, but as ''Footrot Flats 4'' in Australasia.)

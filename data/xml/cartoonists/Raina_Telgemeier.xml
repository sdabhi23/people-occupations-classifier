'''Raina Telgemeier''' (born May 26, 1977) is an American [[cartoonist]] whose works include the [[autobiography|autobiographic]] [[webcomic]] ''Smile (A Dental Drama)'', which was published by [[Scholastic Press]]'s Graphix imprint as a full-color [[graphic novel]] in February 2010. ''Smile'', as well as the follow-up ''Sisters'' and the fiction graphic novel ''[[Drama (graphic novel)|Drama]]'' have all been on ''The New York Times'' Best Seller lists. Telgemeier has also created four ''[[The Baby-Sitters Club]]'' graphic novels.

==Personal life==
Telgemeier was born May 26, 1977, in [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scholastic.com/teachers/authors/raina-telgemeier/|title=Raina Telgemeier {{!}} Scholastic|website=www.scholastic.com|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; to parents Denis and Sue. She has two younger siblings, Amara and Will Telgemeier.&lt;ref name=HornBook&gt;{{Cite interview |url=http://www.hbook.com/2014/10/authors-illustrators/interviews/raina-telgemeier/#_|title=Raina Telgemeier: An illustrated life |interviewer=Jennifer M. Brabander |subject=Raina Telgemeier |publisher=The Horn Book |date=16 October 2014 |language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her pre-teen years, Telgemeier suffered a serious mouth injury that required several years of [[Dentistry|dental]] and [[orthodontic]] surgery (which is described in her 2010 [[graphic novel]] ''[[Smile (graphic novel)|Smile]]'').&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://goraina.com/about/|title=About Raina |website=goraina.com|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was viciously teased by her friends,&lt;ref name=Cosmopolitan /&gt; prompting her to partially withdraw into her love of drawing until she lost her patience when her friends publicly humiliated her. She eventually found new friends of better character in high school who appreciated her artistic talent, increasing her confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://goraina.squarespace.com/writing |title=Writing From Life (The Good and the Bad) |author=Telgemeier, Raina |date= |website=GoRaina |accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With that encouragement, she studied illustration at New York's [[School of Visual Arts]] (SVA),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/14/drawn-together-by-a-love-of-cartooning/ |title=Drawn Together by a Love of Cartooning |author=Mallozzi, Vincent M. |date=14 October 2010 |website=City Room [blog] |publisher=The New York Times |access-date=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and graduated in 2002.&lt;ref name=Cosmopolitan&gt;{{cite interview |url=http://www.cosmopolitan.com/career/a63918/raina-telgemeier-graphic-novelist-get-that-life/ |title=Get That Life: How I Became a Best-Selling Graphic Novelist |subject=Raina Telgemeier |interviewer=Heather Wood Rudulph |date=12 September 2016 |publisher=Cosmopolitan |accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

She currently lives in [[San Francisco]], [[California]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Previously, she lived in [[Astoria, Queens|Astoria]], [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scholastic.com/content/dam/teachers/lesson-plans/migrated-featured-files/scholastic_sisters.pdf|title=A GUIDE TO RAINA TELGEMEIER’S Sisters|last=Brenner|first=Robin E.|date=|publisher=Scholastic |access-date=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influences===
She lists [[Jeff Smith (cartoonist)|Jeff Smith]], [[Lynn Johnston]], [[Bill Watterson]] and [[Adrian Tomine]] among her influences.&lt;ref name=Cosmopolitan /&gt; Other influences include [[Judy Blume]], [[Beverly Cleary]], and [[Laura Ingalls Wilder]], and she cites ''[[Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH]]'' as her all-time favorite book.&lt;ref name=NYer&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/ghosts-raina-telgemeier-returns |title="''Ghosts''": Raina Telgemeier returns |author=Larson, Sarah |date=13 September 2016 |magazine=The New Yorker |accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After graduating from SVA, Telgemeier began attending small-press festivals such as the [[MoCCA Festival]], selling self-published autobiographical stories and vignettes from her life. She produced seven mini-comics issues in the ''Take-Out'' series between 2002 and 2005. Each was a twelve-page black-and-white comic.&lt;ref name=Cosmopolitan /&gt; Other early works include a short story in ''Bizarro World'' for [[DC Comics]], and a short story in Volume 4 of the ''[[Flight (comic)|Flight]]'' anthology.&lt;ref name=Books /&gt;

In 2004, Telgemeier met an editor from Scholastic at an art gallery party who mentioned that Scholastic was planning to set up a graphic novel imprint (which later became Graphix). At that year's [[San Diego Comic-Con]], Telgemeier met that editor's boss, who invited her to pitch an idea for Scholastic. When Telgemeier mentioned she had been a fan of [[Ann M. Martin]]'s ''[[The Baby-sitters Club]]'' series, they asked her to work up a graphic novel adaptation.&lt;ref name=Cosmopolitan /&gt; Scholastic/Graphix went on to publish four graphic novels in the series: ''Kristy's Great Idea'', ''The Truth About Stacey'', ''Mary Anne Saves the Day'', and ''Claudia and Mean Janine''.&lt;ref name=Books&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://goraina.com/books/|title=Books by Raina |website=goraina.com|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advances for the adaptations allowed Telgemeier to quit her full-time job and concentrate on her art, and she completed the fourth novel in 2008.&lt;ref name=Cosmopolitan /&gt;

At the same time, Telgemeier was invited to join [[Girlamatic]], a subscription-based webcomics site with an emphasis on stories for young women. The disciplined structure and schedule of publishing a weekly webcomic encouraged Telgemeier to develop the autobiographical story that would later be published in 2010 as ''Smile''. By the time she had completed work on the ''Babysitters Club'' adaptations in 2008, she had developed a substantial amount of ''Smile'' and received encouragement from Scholastic to continue work.&lt;ref name=Cosmopolitan /&gt;

In August 2009, [[Del Rey Manga]] released ''[[X-Men: Misfits]]'', which Telgemeier co-authored with her husband, [[Dave Roman]].&lt;ref name=Books /&gt;

In February 2010, Telgemeier released ''Smile'', which reached ''The New York Times'' bestseller list in 2011 and remained on the list for over 220 weeks.&lt;ref name=Cosmopolitan /&gt;

In September 2012, her graphic novel ''Drama'' about a middle school stage crew and performers, was released. Although the novel was fictional, it drew on experiences from Telgemeier's experience in middle school and high school theater.&lt;ref name=Cosmopolitan /&gt;

In August 2014, her second autobiographical graphic novel, [[Sisters (graphic novel)|''Sisters'']], about her life growing up with her younger sister, was released.&lt;ref name=Cosmopolitan /&gt;

Telgemeier has also published stories in ''Nursery Rhyme Comics'' (2011, First Second) and ''Fairy Tale Comics'' (2013, First Second); the ''Explorer'' graphic novel series (2012, 2013, Abrams/Amulet); and ''Comics Squad: Recess!'' (2014, Random House).&lt;ref name=Books /&gt;

In September  2016, ''Ghosts'' was released, which is about a girl and her family moving to a new town. The girl is able to see ghosts and some events in the novel are set in late October, when the town is celebrating the [[Day of the Dead]]. Telgemeier stated she had been developing ''Ghosts'' since 2002.&lt;ref name=Cosmopolitan /&gt;

==Reception==
Telgemeier was nominated for the 2005 [[Eisner Award]] for Talent Deserving of Wider Recognition, and the 2003 [[Ignatz Award]] in the categories of Promising New Talent and Outstanding Mini-comic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spxpo.com/2003-ignatz-award-recipients|title=2003 Ignatz Award Recipients {{!}} SPX: The Small Press Expo|website=www.spxpo.com|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was awarded [[Friends of Lulu]]'s [[Kim Yale|Kimberly Yale]] Award for Best New Talent in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://friendsoflulu.wordpress.com/lulu-awards/|title=Lulu Awards|website=Friends Of Lulu|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has twice been nominated for the [[Web Cartoonists' Choice Award]] for Outstanding Slice-of-Life webcomic, for her webcomic ''Smile (A Dental Drama)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scholastic.com/browse/article.jsp?id=3754274|title=A Graphic Novel Smiles! {{!}} News For Kids, By Kids {{!}} Scholastic.com|website=www.scholastic.com|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, she won the Eisner Award for Best Writer/Artist for her graphic novel ''Sisters''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.comic-con.org/awards/2015-eisner-award-nominations |title=2015 Eisner Award Nominations |website=Comic-Con International: San Diego |access-date=2016-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613194937/http://www.comic-con.org/awards/2015-eisner-award-nominations |archivedate=2015-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

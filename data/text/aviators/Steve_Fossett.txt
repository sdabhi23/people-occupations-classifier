Fossett disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying a light aircraft over the Great Basin Desert, between Nevada and California. Extensive searches proved unsuccessful, and he was declared death in absentia declared legally dead in February of the following year.

In September 2008, a hiker found Fossetts identification cards  in the Sierra Nevada (U.S.) Sierra Nevada Mountains, California, leading shortly after to the discovery of the planes wreckage. Fossetts only known remains, two large bones, were found half a mile from the crash site, probably scattered by wild animals.<ref>{{Cite web url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/10/02/steve.fossett.search/index.html title=Some remains found in Fossett plane wreckage - CNN.com website=www.cnn.com language=en access-date=2017-05-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/3125782/Body-parts-found-in-wreckage-of-Steve-Fossetts-plane.html title=Body parts found in wreckage of Steve Fossetts plane last=York first=By Tom Leonard in New work=Telegraph.co.uk access-date=2017-05-13 language=en}}</ref>

==Records==

===Overview===
Steve Fossett was well known for his world records and adventures in balloons, sailboats, gliders, and powered aircraft. He was an aviator of exceptional breadth of experience. He wanted to become the first person to achieve a solo balloon (aircraft) balloon flight around the world (finally succeeding on his sixth attempt, in 2002, becoming the first person to complete an uninterrupted and unrefueled solo circumnavigation of the world in any kind of aircraft). He set, with co-pilot Terry Delore, 10 of the 21 Glider Open records, including the first 2,000&nbsp;km Out-and-Return, the first 1,500&nbsp;km Triangle and the longest Straight Distance flights. His achievements as a jet pilot in a Cessna Citation X include records for U.S. Transcontinental, Australia Transcontinental, and Round-the-World westbound non-supersonic flights.<ref name="eagletter">{{cite journal   title=Fossett Sets Another World Record   journal=Eagletter year=Fall 2006  volume=32  issue=2  pages= 11}}</ref> Prior to Fossetts aviation records, no pilot had held world records in more than one class of aircraft; Fossett held them in four classes.<ref name="airportjournal"/>

In 2005 Fossett made the first solo, nonstop unrefueled circumnavigation of the world in an airplane, in 67 hours in the Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer, a single-engine jet aircraft.

In 2006, he again circumnavigated the globe nonstop and unrefueled in 76 hours, 45 minutes in the GlobalFlyer, setting the record for the longest flight by any aircraft in history with a distance of 25,766 statute miles (41,467&nbsp;km).<ref name="telegraphJune2007"/>

In 2002, he became the first person to fly around the world alone, nonstop in any kind of aircraft. He launched the 10-story high balloon Spirit of Freedom from Northam, Western Australia on June 19, 2002 and returned to Australia on July 3, 2002, subsequently landing in Queensland. Duration and distance of this solo balloon flight was 13 days, 8 hours, 33 minutes (14 days 19 hours 50 minutes to landing), 20,626.48 statute miles (33,195.10&nbsp;km).<ref name="apachievements"/> The balloon dragged him along the ground for 20 minutes at the end of the flight.

While Fossett had financed five previous tries himself, his successful record-setting flight was sponsored by Bud Light.<ref name="smithsonian_freedom_capsule"/> In the end, Fossett actually made money on all his balloon flights. He bought a contingency insurance policy for $500,000 that would pay him $3 million if he succeeded in the flight. Along with sponsorship, that payout meant that in the end Fossett did not have to spend any of his money other than for initial expenses.<ref name="airportjournal"/>

===Sailor===
Fossett was one of Sailing ship tactics sailings most prolific distance record holders. Speed sailing was his specialty and from 1993 to 2004 he dominated the record sheets, setting 23 official world records and nine distance race records. He is recognized by the World Sailing Speed Record Council as "the worlds most accomplished speed sailor."<ref name="telegraphJune2007"/>

On the maxi-catamaran Cheyenne (catamaran) Cheyenne (formerly named PlayStation), Fossett twice set the prestigious 24 hours distance record 24 Hour Record of Sailing. In October 2001, Fossett and his crew set a transatlantic sailing record transatlantic record of 4 days 17 hours, shattering the previous record by 43 hours 35 minutes; an increase in average speed of nearly seven knots.

In early 2004, Fossett, as skipper, set the Around the world sailing record of 58 days, 9 hours in Cheyenne with a crew of 13. In 2007, Fossett held the world record for crossing the Pacific Ocean in his {{convert 125 ft m adj=on}} sailboat, the PlayStation, which he accomplished on his fourth try.<ref name="stanfordalumni"/><ref name="yachtsman"/>

===Fixed-wing aircraft pilot===

====GlobalFlyer====

Fossett made the first solo nonstop unrefueled fixed-wing aircraft flight around the world between February 28 and March 3, 2005. He took off from Salina, Kansas, where he was assisted by faculty members and students from Kansas State University, and flew eastbound with the prevailing winds, returning to Salina after 67 hours, 1 minute, 10 seconds, without refueling or making intermediate landings. His average speed of {{convert 342.2 mph km/h abbr=on}} was also the absolute world record for "speed around the world, nonstop and non-refueled." His aircraft, the Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer, had a carbon fiber reinforced plastic airframe with a single Williams FJ44 turbofan engine. It was designed and built by Burt Rutan and his company, Scaled Composites, for long-distance solo flight. The fuel fraction, the weight of the fuel divided by the weight of the aircraft at take-off, was 83 percent.<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11279696/ Fossett sets record for longest nonstop flight] February 11, 2006</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4316599.stm "Fossett sets solo flight record"] – BBC News article dated March 3, 2005</ref><ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2005/TECH/03/03/globalflyer.fossett/ "Fossett makes history"] – CNN.com article dated March 4, 2005</ref>

On February 11, 2006, Fossett set the absolute world record for "distance without landing" by flying from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, around the world eastbound, then upon returning to Florida continuing across the Atlantic a second time to land in Bournemouth, England. The official distance was 25,766 statute miles (41,467&nbsp;km) and the duration was 76 hours 45 minutes.

The next month, Fossett made a third flight around the world in order to break the absolute record for "Distance over a closed circuit without landing" (with takeoff and landing at the same airport). He took off from Salina, Kansas on March 14, 2006 and returned on March 17, 2006 after flying 25,262 statute miles (40,655&nbsp;km).

There are only seven absolute world records for fixed-wing aircraft recognized by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale and Fossett broke three of them in the Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer.<ref>{{cite web url=http://records.fai.org/general_aviation/absolute.asp  title=Current Absolute General Aviation World Records  publisher=Records.fai.org  accessdate=July 18, 2010  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628225432/http://records.fai.org/general_aviation/absolute.asp <!--Added by H3llBot-->  archivedate=June 28, 2010}}</ref> All three records were previously held by Dick Rutan and Jeana Yeager from their flight in the Rutan Voyager Voyager in 1986.

====Transcontinental aircraft records====
Fossett set two U.S. transcontinental fixed-wing aircraft records in the same day. On February 5, 2003, Fossett and co-pilot Doug Travis flew his Cessna Citation X jet from San Diego, California to Charleston, South Carolina in 2 hours, 56 minutes, 20 seconds, at an average speed of {{convert 726.83 mph km/h abbr=on}} to smash the transcontinental record for non-supersonic jets.

He returned to San Diego, then flew the same course as co-pilot for fellow adventurer Joe Ritchie in Ritchies turboprop Piaggio Avanti. Their time was 3 hours, 51 minutes, 52 seconds, an average speed of {{convert 546.44 mph km/h abbr=on}}, which broke the previous turboprop transcontinental record held by Chuck Yeager and Renald Davenport.

Fossett also set the east-to-west transcontinental record for non-supersonic fixed-wing aircraft on September 17, 2000. He flew from Jacksonville, Florida to San Diego, California in 3 hours, 29 minutes, at an average speed of {{convert 591.96 mph km/h abbr=on}}.

====First trans-Atlantic flight re-enactment====
On July 2, 2005, Fossett and co-pilot Mark Rebholz recreated the first nonstop crossing of the Atlantic which was made by the British team of Alcock and Brown John Alcock and Arthur Whitten Brown in June 1919 in a Vickers Vimy biplane. Their flight from St. Johns, Newfoundland and Labrador St. Johns, Newfoundland, Canada to Clifden, County Galway, Ireland in the open cockpit Vickers Vimy replica took 18 hours 25 minutes with 13 hours flown in instrument flight conditions. Because there was no airport in Clifden, Fossett and Rebholz landed on the 8th fairway of the Connemara Golf Links.<ref name="airportjournal"/>

====Glider records====
The team of Steve Fossett and Terry Delore (NZ) set ten official world records in gliders while flying in three major locations: New Zealand, Argentina, and Nevada, United States. An asterisk (*) indicates records subsequently broken by other pilots.

Fossett and Enevoldson had made previous attempts in three countries over a period of five years before finally succeeding with this record flight. This endeavor is known as the Perlan Project.

===Cross-country skiing===
As a young adventurer, Fossett was one of the first participants in the Worldloppet, a series of cross country ski marathons around the world. While he had little experience as a skier, he was in the first group of citizen athletes to participate in the series debut in 1979. And in 1980, he became the eighth skier to complete all 10 of the long distance races, earning a Worldloppet medallion. He has also set cross-country skiing records in Colorado, setting an Aspen, Colorado Aspen to Vail, Colorado Vail record of 59&nbsp;h, 53&nbsp;min, 30&nbsp;s in February 1998, and an Aspen to Eagle, Colorado Eagle record of 12 hr, 29 min in February 2001.<ref name="airportjournal"/>

===Mountain climbing===
Fossett was a lifelong mountain climber and had climbed the highest peaks on six of the seven continents.<ref name="stanfordalumni"/><ref name="foxnews"/> In the 1980s, he became friends with Patrick Morrow, who was attempting to climb the highest peaks on all seven continents for the "Seven Summits" world record, which Morrow achieved in 1985.  Fossett accompanied Morrow for his last three peaks, including Vinson Massif in Antarctica, Carstensz Pyramid in Oceania, and Elbrus in Europe.<ref name="airportjournal"/> While Fossett went on to climb almost all of the Seven Summits peaks himself, he declined to climb Mount Everest in 1992 due to asthma.<ref name="airportjournal"/> He later returned to Antarctica to climb again.

===Other accomplishments===
Fossett competed in and completed premier endurance sports events, including the {{convert 1165 mi km adj=on}} Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, in which he finished 47th on his second try in 1992 after training for five years. He became the 270th person to swim across the English Channel on his fourth try in September 1985 with a time of 22 hours, 15 minutes.<ref name="airportjournal"/><ref name="stanfordalumni"/><ref name="apachievements"/> Although Fossett said he was not a good enough swimmer "to make the varsity swim team", he found that he could swim for long periods.<ref name="airportjournal"/> Fossett competed in the Ironman Triathlon in Hawaii<ref name="stlpostdispatch"/> (finishing in 1996 in 15:53:10),<ref>{{cite web

===Previous attempts at records===
Fossett tried six times over seven years for the first solo balloon circumnavigation. His fifth attempt cost him $1.25 million of his own money; his sixth and successful attempt was commercially sponsored.<ref name="airportjournal"/> Two of the attempts were launched from Busch Memorial Stadium in St. Louis, Missouri. Washington University in St. Louis served as control center for four of the six flights, including the record-breaking one.<ref name="stlpostdispatch"/>

In 1998, one of the unsuccessful attempts at the ballooning record ended with a five-mile (8&nbsp;km) plummet into the Coral Sea off the coast of Australia that nearly killed Fossett;<ref name="npr2007"/> he waited 72 hours to be rescued, at a cost of $500,000.<ref name="stlpostdispatch"/><ref name="knightridder2002">{{cite web

After taking too much fuel to cross the Atlantic Ocean and circling Libya for 12 hours while officials decided whether or not to allow him into their airspace, Fossett did not have enough fuel to finish the flight. That year, Fossett flew farther for less money than better-financed expeditions (including one supported by Richard Branson) in part due to his ability to fly in an unpressurized capsule, a result of his heavy physical training at high altitudes.<ref name="stanfordalumni"/> The Solo Spirit capsule was put on display at the Smithsonians National Air and Space Museum across from the Apollo 11 command module.<ref name="stanfordalumni"/>

==Scouting==
Fossett grew up in Garden Grove, California and earned the Eagle Scout award in 1957. He credited his experience in Scouting as a foundation for much of his later success. "As a Scout, I learned how to set goals and achieve them," he once said. "Being a Scout also taught me leadership at a young age when there are few opportunities to be a leader. Scouting values have remained with me throughout my life, in my business career, and now as I take on new challenges."<ref name="Eagletter Winter 2007"/> In his later years, he was described as a "legend" by fellow Scouts.<ref name="jacksonsun">{{cite news    last =Beadle

Fossett previously had served on the World Scout Committee.<ref name="airportjournal"/>

Fossett was honored with the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award in 1992. In 1999 he received the Silver Buffalo Award, BSAs highest recognition of service to youth.<ref name=boyscoutsPR/>

==Awards and honors==

In 2002, Fossett received aviations highest award, the Gold Medal of the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) and in July 2007, he was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame Aviation Hall of Fame.<ref name="telegraphJune2007"/> He was presented at the ceremony by Dick Rutan.

In 1997, Fossett was inducted into the Balloon and Airship Hall of Fame.<ref name="airportjournal"/> In February 2002, Fossett was named Americas Rolex Yachtsman of the Year by the American Sailing Association at the New York Yacht Club.<ref name="yachtsman"/> He was the oldest recipient of the award in its 41-year history, and the only recipient to fly himself to the ceremony in his own plane.<ref name="yachtsman"/>

He received the Explorers Medal from the Explorers Club following his solo balloon circumnavigation. He was given the Diplôme de Montgolfier by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale in 1996. He received the Harmon Trophy, given annually "to the worlds outstanding aviator and aeronaut", in 1998 and 2002. He received the Grande Médaille of the Aéro-Club de France, and the British Royal Aero Clubs Gold Medal in 2002.

===Disappearance and search===
File:Champion 8kcab super decathlon g-ezpz arp.jpg thumb right Champion 8KCAB Super Decathlon
At 8:45 a.m. on the morning of Monday, September 3, 2007 (Labor Day), Fossett took off in a single-engine American Champion Decathlon Super Decathlon light aircraft from the Flying-M Ranch private airstrip ({{Coord 38 36 13 N 119 00 11 W type:airport_region:US-NV_scale:10000 name=Flying-M Ranch}}), near Smith Valley, Nevada.

When he failed to return, searches were launched about six hours later. The aircraft had Aircraft registration tail number {{Airreg N 240R}} registered to the "Flying M Hunting Club, Inc." There was no signal from the planes Emergency position-indicating radiobeacon station emergency locator transmitter (ELT) designed to be automatically activated in the event of a crash, but it was of an older type notorious for failing to operate after a crash.<ref>{{cite news  url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-09-05-fossett_N.htm?csp=34  title=Fossett search stresses need for new beacons   access-date = September 8, 2007  author=Levin, Alan  date= September 6, 2007   work=USA Today publisher= Gannett  pages=  quote=The small plane piloted by Fossett, 63, was equipped with an older emergency beacon that is notorious for failing to operate after crashes, according to federal safety officials and the agencies that monitor the emergency beacons.}}</ref><ref>{{cite news

On the first day of CAP searching, operations were suspended by mid-day due to high winds, according to Ryan. By the fourth day, the CAP was using fourteen aircraft in the search effort, including one equipped with the Airborne Real-time Cueing Hyperspectral Enhanced Reconnaissance ARCHER system that could automatically scan detailed imaging for a given signature of the missing aircraft.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story.jsp?id=news/Foss09067.xml&headline=Advanced%20Recon%20System%20Aids%20Fossett%20Search&channel=null title= Advanced Recon System Aids Fossett Search  access-date = September 8, 2007  author= Fiorino, Frances  date=September 2007    work=Aviation Week publisher= McGraw-Hill  quote=According to CAP, a set of parameters describing the intended target, including its color and shape, is programmed into the ARCHER system.}}</ref>

All told, about two dozen aircraft were involved in the massive search, operating from the primary search base at Minden, Nevada, with a secondary search base located at Bishop, California. CAP searchers came from Wings across the United States, including Nevada, Utah, California, Arizona, New Mexico, Idaho, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Texas.<ref>http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/09/08/fossett.ap/index.html {{Dead link date=October 2008}}</ref>

On September 7, Google Google Inc. helped the search for the aviator through its connections to contractors that provide satellite imagery for its Google Earth software. Richard Branson, a British billionaire and friend of Fossett, said he and others were coordinating efforts with Google to see if any of the high-resolution images might include Fossetts aircraft.

On September 8, the first of a series of new high-resolution imagery from DigitalGlobe was made available via the Amazon Mechanical Turk beta website so that users could flag potential areas of interest for searching, in what is known as crowdsourcing. By September 11, up to 50,000 people had joined the effort, scrutinizing more than 300,000 278-square-foot squares of the imagery. Peter Cohen of Amazon believed that by September 11, the entire search area had been covered at least once. Amazons search effort was shut down the week of October 29, without any measurable success.<ref name="wired 11 sept">[https://www.wired.com/software/webservices/news/2007/09/distributed_search 50,000 Volunteers Join Distributed Search For Steve Fossett], Wired (magazine)#Website Wired News, By Steve Friess, September 11, 2007, 2:00 p.m.</ref><ref name="WiredNov6">{{cite web   title=Online Fossett Searchers Ask, Was It Worth It?   last=Friess   first=Steve   work=Wired   url=http://archive.wired.com/techbiz/it/news/2007/11/fossett_search    date=November 6, 2007    access-date=July 15, 2016 }}</ref> Major Cynthia Ryan later said it had been more of a hindrance than a help.<ref name="WiredNov6" /> She said that persons purporting to have seen the aircraft on the Mechanical Turk or have special knowledge clogged her email during critical days of the search, and for even months afterward. Many of the ostensible sightings proved to be images of CAP aircraft flying search grids, or simply mistaken artifacts of old images. Psychics flooded the search base in Minden with predictions of where the aviator could be found. Ryan got the majority of these calls personally, often at her home, in the middle of the night. One man from Canada was particularly persistent with daily calls to Ryan, interfering with her press briefings. Ryan asked her Incident Commander to issue a cease and desist order, backed up by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) if necessary. Ryan noted that every message, letter, or phone call was taken seriously, which swamped the USAF specialists assigned the task of reviewing every one of them without regard to apparent plausibility. In retrospect, the crowdsource effort was "not ready for prime time", according to Ryan.

On September 12, survival experts speculated that Fossett was likely to be dead.<ref>http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/09/12/fossett.search.ap/index.html  {{webarchive  url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912203918/http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/09/12/fossett.search.ap/index.html   title=Survival experts doubt Fossett is still alive   date=September 12, 2007 }}</ref><ref>"Steve Fossett likely dead, survival experts say", http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20732023/</ref>

On March 5, 2009, the NTSB issued its report and findings.<ref>{{Cite web url=http://ntsb.gov/ntsb/brief2.asp?ev_id=20081007X17184&ntsbno=SEA07FA277&akey=1  title=National Transportation Safety Board Report  publisher=Ntsb.gov  id=SEA07FA277  access-date=July 18, 2010  postscript={{inconsistent citations}}  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714203049/http://www.ntsb.gov/ntsb/brief2.asp?ev_id=20081007X17184&ntsbno=SEA07FA277&akey=1  archivedate=July 14, 2009  df= }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal title=Factual Report – Aviation  url=http://www.ntsb.gov/ntsb/GenPDF.asp?id=SEA07FA277&rpt=fa publisher=National Transportation Safety Board  id=SEA07FA277 date=July 9, 2009 access-date=July 9, 2010 postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

The elevation of peaks in the area exceeded {{convert 13000 ft m}}. However, the density altitude in the area at the time and place of the crash was estimated to be {{convert 12700 ft m}}. The aircraft, a tandem two-seater, was nearly 30 years old and Fossett had flown approximately 40 hours in this type. The planes operating manual says that at an altitude of {{convert 13000 ft m}} the rate of climb would be 300 feet per minute (about 1.5&nbsp;m/s). The NTSB report says that "a meteorologist from Salinas, California Salinas provided a numerical simulation of the conditions in the accident area using the WRF-ARW (Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting) numerical model. At 0930 [the approximate time of the crash] the model displayed downdrafts in that area of approximately 300 feet per minute." There was no evidence of equipment failure. The report stated that a postmortem examination of the skeletal fragments had been performed under the auspices of the Madera County Sheriffs Department. The cause of death was determined to be multiple traumatic injuries. The ELT was destroyed by the crash.

On July 9, 2009, the NTSB declared the probable cause of the crash as "the pilots inadvertent encounter with downdrafts that exceeded the climb capability of the airplane. Contributing to the accident were the downdrafts, high density altitude, and mountainous terrain."<ref>{{Cite web author=National Transportation Safety Board url=http://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/brief2.aspx?ev_id=20081007X17184&ntsbno=SEA07FA277&akey=1 title=SEA07FA277: Full Narrative date=July 9, 2009 access-date=July 14, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/07/09/fossett.crash.cause/index.html  title=Investigators: Strong winds probable cause of Fossett crash  publisher=CNN.com  date= July 9, 2009 access-date=April 24, 2010}}</ref>

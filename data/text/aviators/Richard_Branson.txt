Branson expressed his desire to become an entrepreneur at a young age. His first business venture, at the age of 16, was a magazine called Student. In 1970, he set up a mail-order record business. He opened a chain of record stores, Virgin Records—later known as Virgin Megastores—in 1972. Bransons Virgin brand grew rapidly during the 1980s, as he set up Virgin Atlantic airline and expanded the Virgin Records music label.

In March 2000, Branson was Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom knighted at Buckingham Palace for "services to entrepreneurship".<ref>{{cite news title=Virgin tycoon is knighted url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/695511.stm agency=BBC date=3 January 2016}}</ref> For his work in retail, music and transport (with interests in land, air, sea and space travel), his taste for adventure, and for his humanitarian work, he became a prominent figure.<ref>{{cite book last1=Barling first1=Julian title=The SAGE Handbook of Organizational Behavior: Volume Two: Macro Approaches publisher=SAGE page=383}}</ref><ref>{{cite news title=Thirty of the very best of British url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10050832/Thirty-of-the-very-best-of-British.html agency=The Telegraph date=13 November 2016}}</ref> In 2002, he was named in the BBCs poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2208671.stm "100 great British heroes"].

==Early life==
Branson was born in Blackheath, London, the eldest of three children of Eve Branson (née Evette Huntley Flindt; born 1924), a former ballet dancer and air hostess, and Edward James Branson (1918–2011), a barrister.<ref>{{cite news  url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/law-obituaries/8501350/Edward-Branson.html   location=London   work=The Daily Telegraph   title=Edward Branson   date=8 May 2011}}<br>- "Births", The Times, 12 July 1950, pg. 1</ref><ref name="fdnr1">[https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/finding-my-roots] Finding Your Roots, 2 February 2016, PBS</ref> He has two younger sisters.<ref name=SagaMar13>{{cite news url=https://www.saga.co.uk/saga-magazine/2013/march/eve-branson.aspx title=Like mother, like son author=Nina Myskow date=13 March 2013 publisher=Saga magazine accessdate=5 November 2014 deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105104205/https://www.saga.co.uk/saga-magazine/2013/march/eve-branson.aspx archivedate=5 November 2014 df=dmy-all}}</ref> His grandfather, the Right Honourable G.

His third great-grandfather, John Edward Branson, left England for India in 1793; John Edwards father, Harry Wilkins Branson, later joined him in Madras. On the show Finding Your Roots, Branson was shown to have 3.9% South Asian (Indian) DNA, likely through intermarriage.<ref name=fdnr1/> He attended Stowe School, an Independent school (United Kingdom) independent school in Buckinghamshire until the age of sixteen.<ref name=TimesSep98/> 

Branson has dyslexia and had poor academic performance; on his last day at school, his headmaster, Robert Drayson, told him he would either end up in prison or become a millionaire.<ref name=TimesSep98/> Bransons parents were supportive of his endeavours from an early age.<ref>{{cite journal last=Shavinina first=Larisa V title=Micro-social factors in the development of entrepreneurial giftedness: the case of Richard Branson journal=High Ability Studies date=December 2006 volume=17 issue=2}}</ref> His mother was an entrepreneur; one of her most successful ventures was building and selling wooden tissue boxes and wastepaper bins.<ref>{{Cite book title=The Virgin Way: Everything I know about leadership last=Branson first=Richard publisher=Portfolio/Penguin year=2014 isbn= location=New York pages= quote= via=}}</ref>

==Career==

===Record business===
Branson started his record business from the church where he ran Student magazine. He interviewed several prominent personalities of the late 1960s for the magazine including Mick Jagger and R. D. Laing.<ref name="Branson2011">{{cite book author=Richard Branson title=Losing My Virginity url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NWxnDythozIC date=4 August 2011 publisher=Ebury Publishing isbn=978-1-4464-8334-3}}</ref> Branson advertised popular records in Student, and it was an overnight success.<ref>{{Cite news  url = http://www.businessinsider.com/richard-branson-fails-virgin-companies-that-went-bust-2012-4?op=1  title=RICHARD BRANSONS FAILS: 14 Virgin Companies That Went Bust  author=Mallory Russell  publisher=Business Insider  date = 21 April 2012}}</ref> Trading under the name "Virgin", he sold records for considerably less than the "High Street" outlets, especially the chain W. H. Smith. Branson once said, "There is no point in starting your own business unless you do it out of a sense of frustration." The name "Virgin" was suggested by one of Bransons early employees because they were all new at business.<ref name="ReferenceA">Richard Branson – Losing my Virginity</ref> At the time, many products were sold under restrictive marketing agreements that limited discounting, despite efforts in the 1950s and 1960s to limit so-called resale price maintenance.<ref>Another example was the Net Book Agreement, which limited the ability of book outlets, including discount book clubs, to offer deep discounts.</ref>

Branson eventually started a record shop in Oxford Street in London. In 1971, he was questioned in connection with the selling of records in Virgin stores that had been declared export stock. The matter was never brought before a court because Branson agreed to repay any unpaid VAT of 33% and a £70,000 fine. His parents re-mortgaged the family home in order to help pay the settlement.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Earning enough money from his record store, Branson in 1972 launched the record label Virgin Records with Nik Powell, and bought a country estate north of Oxford in which he installed a residential recording studio, The Manor Studio.<ref>{{Cite news  url = http://www.biography.com/people/richard-branson-9224520 title=Richard Branson Biography publisher=A&E Television Networks  website=The Biography.com website accessdate =16 September 2014}}</ref> He leased studio time to fledgling artists, including multi-instrumentalist Mike Oldfield, whose debut album Tubular Bells (1973) was the first release for Virgin Records and became a chart-topping best-seller.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03cw8g0  title=Tubular Bells: The Mike Oldfield Story  publisher=BBC  accessdate=22 April 2015}}</ref>

Virgin signed such controversial bands as the Sex Pistols, which other companies were reluctant to sign. Virgin Records would go on to sign other artists including the Rolling Stones, Peter Gabriel, XTC, UB40, Steve Winwood and Paula Abdul, and to become the worlds largest independent record label.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/197616 title=Richard Branson  The P.T.

Virgin Records also introduced Culture Club to the music world. In 1982, Virgin purchased the gay nightclub Heaven (nightclub) Heaven. In 1991, in a consortium with David Frost, Branson made an unsuccessful bid for three ITV (TV network) ITV franchisees under the CPV-TV name. The early 1980s also saw his only attempt as a producer—on the novelty record "Baa, Baa, Black Sheep", by Singing Sheep in association with Doug McLean and Grace McDonald. The recording was a series of sheep baa-ing along to a drum-machine-produced track and reached number 42 in the UK charts in 1982.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://epnofny.com/epnmag/blog/2012/12/02/entrepreneur-guru-sir-richard-branson/  title=Entrepreneur Guru Sir Richard Branson  publisher=EPN  date=2 December 2012  accessdate=22 April 2015}}</ref>

===Business ventures===
{{Main article Timeline of Richard Bransons business ventures}}
Branson formed Virgin Atlantic Airways in 1984, launched Virgin Mobile in 1999, and Virgin Blue in Australia (now named Virgin Australia) in 2000. He was ninth in Sunday Times Rich List The Sunday Times Rich List 2006 of the wealthiest people or families in the UK, worth slightly more than £3&nbsp;billion. Branson wrote in his autobiography of the decision to start an airline.

{{quote "My interest in life comes from setting myself huge, apparently unachievable challenges and trying to rise above them ... from the perspective of wanting to live life to the full, I felt that I had to attempt it."}}

Bransons first successful entry into the airline industry was during a trip to Puerto Rico. His flight was cancelled, so he decided to charter his own plane the rest of the way and offer a ride to the rest of the stranded passengers for a small fee in order to cover the cost.<ref>{{Cite web url=http://www.businessinsider.com/richard-branson-entrepreneur-visionary-2011-5/ title=Richard Branson: How a Cancelled Flight Led To The Worlds Greatest Travel Empire last=Zeveloff first=J date=May 2011 website= publisher= access-date=18 October 2016}}</ref>

In 1993, Branson took what many saw as being one of his riskier business exploits by entering into the railway business. Virgin Trains won the franchises for the former Inter-city rail Intercity West Coast Main Line West Coast and Cross-Country sectors of British Rail.

Virgin acquired European short-haul airline Euro Belgian Airlines in 1996 and renamed it Virgin Express. In 2006, the airline was merged with SN Brussels Airlines forming Brussels Airlines.<ref>{{Cite news url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/virgin-express-creates-brussels-airline-566542.html title=Virgin Express creates Brussels airline date=2004-03-17 work=The Independent access-date=2018-05-04 language=en-GB}}</ref> It also started a national airline based in Nigeria, called Virgin Nigeria, which ceased operations in 2009.<ref>{{Cite news url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8089858.stm title=Virgin to sell Nigerian airline date=2009-06-08 access-date=2018-05-04 language=en-GB}}</ref> Another airline, Virgin America, began flying out of San Francisco International Airport in August 2007.

A series of disputes in the early 1990s caused tension between Virgin Atlantic and British Airways, which viewed Virgin as an emerging competitor. Virgin subsequently accused British Airways of poaching its passengers, hacker (computer security) hacking its computers, and leaking stories to the press that portrayed Virgin negatively. After the so-called campaign of "dirty tricks", British Airways settled the case, giving £500,000 to Branson, a further £110,000 to his airline, and had to pay legal fees of up to £3&nbsp;million. Branson distributed his compensation (the so-called "BA bonus") among his staff.<ref>{{cite news  url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/aug/02/theairlineindustry.britishairways  title= Row over dirty tricks led to decade of hostilities author=Lee Glendinning   date=2 August 2007  work=The Guardian  accessdate=31 August 2011  location=London}}</ref>

On 25 September 2004, Branson announced the signing of a deal under which a new space tourism company, Virgin Galactic, will license the technology behind Spaceship One—funded by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and designed by legendary American aeronautical engineer and visionary Burt Rutan—to take paying passengers into suborbital Outer space space. Virgin Galactic (wholly owned by Virgin Group) plans to make flights available to the public with tickets priced at US$200,000 using Scaled Composites White Knight Two.<ref name=sn20131111>

Bransons next venture with the Virgin group was Virgin Fuels, which was set up to respond to global warming and exploit the recent spike in fuel costs by offering a revolutionary, cheaper fuel for automobiles and, in the near future, aircraft. Branson has stated that he was formerly a Climate change denial global warming sceptic and was influenced in his decision by a breakfast meeting with Al Gore.<ref>{{cite web url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=2477400  title=ABC News: Breakfast With Al Gore Persuades Branson to Pledge Billions to Global Warming  publisher=ABC News  date=22 September 2006  accessdate=14 September 2010}}</ref>

On 21 September 2006, Branson pledged to invest the profits of Virgin Atlantic and Virgin Trains in research for environmentally-friendly fuels. The investment is estimated to be worth $3&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{cite web   url=http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/index.php?menuID=1&subID=770   title=Come fly with me, come give it away   accessdate=23 September 2006   deadurl=yes   archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65U04AmZI?url=http://www.theweek.co.uk/index.php?menuID=1&subID=770   archivedate=16 February 2012   df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web

On 4 July 2006, Branson sold his Virgin Mobile company to UK cable TV, broadband, and telephone company NTL/NTL:Telewest for almost £1&nbsp;billion. A new company was launched with much fanfare and publicity on 8 February 2007, under the name Virgin Media. The decision to merge his Virgin Media Company with NTL was to integrate both of the companies compatible parts of commerce. Branson used to own three-quarters of Virgin Mobile, whereas now he owns 15 percent of the new Virgin Media company.<ref name="Perry">{{Cite news  last = Fryer  first =Pat   title = Uma Thurman to promote Virgin Media  publisher=earthtimes.org  date = 23 January 2007  url = http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/23001.html  accessdate =2 February 2007}}</ref>

In June 2006, a tip-off from Virgin Atlantic led both UK and US competition authorities to investigate price-fixing attempts between Virgin Atlantic and British Airways. In August 2007, British Airways was fined £271&nbsp;million over the allegations. Virgin Atlantic was given immunity for tipping off the authorities and received no fine—a controversial decision the Office of Fair Trading defended as being in the public interest.<ref>{{cite news  author=Ruth Sunderland  location=London  url=https://www.theguardian.com/airlines/story/0,,2141647,00.html  title=OFT defends snitch policy   date=5 August 2007 accessdate=14 September 2010}}</ref>

On 9 February 2007, Branson announced the setting up of a new global science and technology prize—The Virgin Earth Challenge—in the belief that history has shown that prizes of this nature encourage technological advancements for the good of mankind. The Virgin Earth Challenge was to award $25&nbsp;million to the individual or group who are able to demonstrate a commercially viable design that will result in the net removal of anthropogenic, atmospheric greenhouse gases each year for at least ten years without countervailing harmful effects. This removal must have long-term effects and contribute materially to the stability of the Earths climate. Branson also announced that he would be joined in the adjudication of the prize by a panel of five judges, all world authorities in their respective fields: Al Gore, Sir Crispin Tickell, Tim Flannery, James E. Hansen, and James Lovelock.

In August 2012, the franchise for the West Coast Main Line, managed by Virgin Rail since 1997, came to an end. The contract was awarded to FirstGroup after a competitive tender process overseen by the Department for Transport. Branson had expressed his concerns about the tender process and questioned the validity of the business plan submitted by FirstGroup. When Virgin Rail lost the contract, Branson said he was convinced the civil servants had "got their maths wrong". In October, after an investigation into the bidding process, the deal was scrapped. The Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin announced there were "significant technical flaws" in the process and mistakes had been made by transport staff. Virgin Rail continues to operate the West Coast line.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19809717 title=West Coast Main Line deal scrapped after contract flaws discovered publisher=BBC News date=3 October 2012 accessdate=2 June 2015}}</ref>

Branson made several world record-breaking attempts after 1985, when in the spirit of the Blue Riband he attempted the fastest Atlantic Ocean crossing. His first attempt in the "Virgin Atlantic Challenger" led to the boat capsizing in British waters and a rescue by RAF helicopter, which received wide media coverage. Some newspapers called for Branson to reimburse the government for the rescue cost. In 1986, in his "Virgin Atlantic Challenger II", with sailing expert Daniel McCarthy, he beat the record by two hours.<ref name=":0">McKenzie, Sheena (25 April 2013) "[http://edition.cnn.com/2013/04/25/business/richard-branson-virgin-atlantic-challenger-ii/ Back to the future for Richard Bransons retro 80s speedboat]".

In January 1991, Branson crossed the Pacific from Japan to Arctic Canada, {{convert 6700 mi km}}, in a balloon of {{convert 2600000 cuft m3}}. This broke the record, with a speed of {{convert 245 mph km/h}}.

Between 1995 and 1998, Branson, Per Lindstrand, Vladimir Dzhanibekov, Larry Newman (aviator) Larry Newman, and Steve Fossett made attempts to circumnavigate the globe by balloon. In late 1998 they made a record-breaking flight from Morocco to Hawaii but were unable to complete a global flight before Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones (aeronaut) Brian Jones in Breitling Orbiter 3 in March 1999.

In March 2004, Branson set a record by travelling from Dover to Calais in a Gibbs Aquada in 1 hour, 40 minutes and 6 seconds, the fastest crossing of the English Channel in an amphibious vehicle. The previous record of six hours was set by two Frenchmen.<ref name="Rick">{{Cite news  last = BBC News  title = Branson sets cross-Channel record publisher=BBC News    date = 14 June 2004   url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/coventry_warwickshire/3805275.stm   accessdate =13 June 2007 }}</ref>
The cast of Top Gear (2002 TV series) Top Gear, Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond, attempted to break this record in an amphibious vehicle which they had constructed and, while successfully crossing the channel, did not break Bransons record. After being intercepted by the Coast Guard and asked what their intentions were, Clarkson remarked "..our intentions are to go across the Channel faster than Beardy Branson!".

==Television, film and print==
File:ETalk2008-Sir Richard Branson.jpg thumb upright left Branson at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival
Branson has guest starred, usually playing himself, on several television shows, including Friends, Baywatch, Birds of a Feather, Only Fools and Horses, The Day Today, a special episode of the comedy Goodness Gracious Me (BBC) Goodness Gracious Me and Tripping Over. Branson made several appearances during the nineties on the BBC Saturday morning show Live & Kicking, where he was referred to as the pickle man by comedy act Trev and Simon (in reference to Branston Pickle).<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.saturdaymornings.co.uk/bbccatalogueprog.shtml?show=livekicking&number=LCKW533F  title=on  publisher=Saturdaymornings.co.uk  accessdate=14 September 2010  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716104401/http://www.saturdaymornings.co.uk/bbccatalogueprog.shtml?show=livekicking&number=LCKW533F  archivedate=16 July 2011  df=dmy-all }}</ref> 

Branson also appears in a cameo early in XTCs "Generals and Majors" video.  He was also the star of a reality television show on Fox Broadcasting Company Fox called The Rebel Billionaire: Bransons Quest for the Best (2004), in which sixteen contestants were tested for their entrepreneurship and sense of adventure. It did not succeed as a rival show to Donald Trumps The Apprentice (U.S. TV Series) The Apprentice and only lasted one season. According to Trump, Bransons "show was terrible. And I thought he was terribly miscast. He’s a lot of hot air, like his balloons".<ref name="Bower2017"/>

His high public profile often leaves him open as a figure of satire—the 2000 AD (comics) 2000 AD series Zenith (comic) Zenith features a parody of Branson as a super villain, as the comics publisher and favoured distributor and the Virgin group were in competition at the time. He is also caricatured in The Simpsons episode "Monty Cant Buy Me Love" as the tycoon Arthur Fortune, as the ballooning Narcissistic personality disorder megalomaniac Richard Chutney (a pun on Branson, as in Branston Pickle) in Believe Nothing, and voiced himself in "The Princess Guide". The character Grandson Richard 39 in Terry Pratchetts Wings is modelled on Branson.

He has a cameo appearance in several films: Around the World in 80 Days (2004 film) Around the World in 80 Days (2004), where he played a hot-air balloon operator, and Superman Returns (2006), where he was credited as a Shuttle Engineer and appeared alongside his son, Sam, with a Virgin Galactic-style commercial suborbital shuttle at the centre of his storyline. He also has a cameo in the James Bond film Casino Royale (2006 film) Casino Royale (2006). Here, he is seen as a passenger going through Miami Airport security check-in and being frisked – several Virgin Atlantic planes appear soon after. British Airways edited out Bransons cameo in their in-flight screening of the movie.<ref>{{cite news url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6579839.stm  title=BA cuts Branson from Bond movie  publisher=BBC News   date=21 April 2007  accessdate=14 September 2010}}</ref> He makes a number of brief and disjointed appearances in the documentary Derek and Clive Get the Horn (1979), which follows the exploits of Peter Cook and Dudley Moore recording their final comedy album.

Branson is a Star Trek fan and named his new spaceship VSS Enterprise VSS Enterprise in honour of the Star Trek spaceships, and in 2006, reportedly offered actor William Shatner a ride on the inaugural space launch of Virgin Galactic. In an interview in Time (magazine) Time magazine, published on 10 August 2009, Shatner claimed that Branson approached him asking how much he would pay for a ride on the spaceship. In response, Shatner asked "how much would you pay me to do it?"

In August 2007, Branson announced on The Colbert Report that he had named a new aircraft Air Colbert. He later doused political satirist and talk show host Stephen Colbert with water from his mug.

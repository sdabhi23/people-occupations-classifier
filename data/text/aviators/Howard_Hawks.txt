==Early life and education==

===Family===
Howard Winchester Hawks was born in Goshen, Indiana, the first-born child of Frank Winchester Hawks (1865–1950), a wealthy paper manufacturer, and his wife, Helen Brown (née Howard; 1872–1952), the daughter of a wealthy industrialist. Hawks family on his fathers side were American pioneers and his ancestor John Hawks had emigrated from England to Massachusetts in 1630. The family eventually settled in Goshen and by the 1890s was one of the wealthiest families in the Midwestern United States Midwest, due mostly to the highly profitable Goshen Milling Company.<ref name="McCarthy">{{cite book last1=McCarthy first1=Todd title=Howard Hawks: The Grey Fox of Hollywood date=1997 publisher=Grove Press location=New York isbn=978-0-8021-3740-1 url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VurpbRg7GRoC&pg=PT59}}</ref>{{rp 18–19}}

Hawks maternal grandfather, C. W. Howard (1845–1916), had homesteaded in Neenah, Wisconsin in 1862 at age 17. Within 15 years he had made his fortune in the towns paper mill and other industrial endeavors.<ref name="McCarthy" />{{rp 25}} Frank Hawks and Helen Howard met in the early  1890s and married in 1895. Howard Hawks was the eldest of five children and his birth was followed by Kenneth Hawks Kenneth Neil Hawks (August 12, 1899 – January 2, 1930), William Hawks William Bellinger Hawks (January 29, 1901 – January 10, 1969), Grace Louise Hawks (October 17, 1903 – December 23, 1927) and Helen Bernice Hawks (1906 – May 4, 1911). In 1898, the family moved to Neenah, Wisconsin where Frank Hawks began working for his father-in-laws Howard Paper Company.<ref name="McCarthy" />{{rp 27–29}}

===Education===
Between 1906 and 1909, the Hawks family began to spend more time in Pasadena, California during the cold Wisconsin winters in order to improve Helen Hawks ill health. Gradually they began to spend only their summers in Wisconsin before permanently moving to Pasadena in 1910.<ref name="McCarthy" />{{rp 31}} The family settled in a house down the street from California Institute of Technology Throop Polytechnic Institute (which would eventually become California Institute of Technology), and the Hawks children began attending the schools Polytechnic School Polytechnic Elementary School in 1907.<ref name="McCarthy" />{{rp 34–35}}

Hawks was an average student at school and did not excel in sports, but by 1910 had discovered Gravity racer coaster racing, an early form of soapbox racing. In 1911, Hawks youngest sibling Helen died suddenly of food poisoning.<ref name="McCarthy" />{{rp 34–36}}<ref name=Wakeman2>{{cite book title= World Film Directors, Volume 1, 1890–1945 location=New York publisher=The H.W.

But in 1912, the Hawks family moved to nearby Glendora, California, where Frank Hawks owned orange groves. Hawks finished his junior year of high school at Citrus Union High School in Glendora.<ref name="McCarthy" />{{rp 36}}<!--guessing at the page number since I cant find it in the Google book scan--> During this time he worked as a barnstorming pilot.<ref name=Barson>{{cite web last1=Barson first1=Michael title=Howard Hawks, American director url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Howard-Hawks website=Encyclopedia Britannica publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica accessdate=7 September 2017 language=en}}</ref>

He was then sent to Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire from 1913 to 1914; his familys wealth may have influenced his acceptance to the elite private school. Even though he was seventeen, he was admitted as a lower middleclassman, the equivalent of a sophomore. While in New England, Hawks often attended the theaters in nearby Boston. In 1914, Hawks returned to Glendora and graduated from Pasadena High School that year.<ref name="McCarthy" />{{rp 36}}<!--guessing at the page number since I cant find it in the Google book scan-->

That same year, Hawks was accepted to Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, where he majored in mechanical engineering and was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon. College friend Ray S. Ashbury remembered Hawks spending more of his time playing craps and drinking alcohol than studying, although Hawks was also known to be a voracious reader of popular American and English novels in college.<ref name="McCarthy" />{{rp 36–39}}

While working in the film industry during his 1916 summer vacation, Hawks made an unsuccessful attempt to transfer to Stanford University. He returned to Cornell that September, leaving in April 1917 to join the United States Army Army when the United States entered World War I. Like many college students who joined the armed services during the war, he received a degree in absentia in 1918. Before Hawks was called for active duty, he returned to Hollywood and by the end of April 1917 was working on a Cecil B. DeMille film.

==Early film career==
In 1916, Hawks met Victor Fleming, a Hollywood cinematographer who had been an auto mechanic and early aviator. Fleming had become involved in the film industry when a friend, Marshall Neilan, recommended Fleming to film director Allan Dwan as a good mechanic. (Fleming impressed Dwan by quickly fixing both his car and a faulty film camera.) By 1916, Fleming had become a cinematographer.

Hawks met Fleming when he began racing and working on a Mercer (automobile) Mercer race car—bought for him by his grandfather, C.W. Howard—during his 1916 summer vacation in California. He allegedly met Fleming when the two men raced on a dirt track and caused an accident.<ref name="McCarthy" />{{rp 39–42}}  <ref name="McCarthy" />{{rp 39–42}}

The meeting with Victor Fleming Fleming led to Hawks first job in the film industry, as a Theatrical property prop boy on the Douglas Fairbanks film In Again, Out Again (on which Fleming was employed as the cinematographer) for Famous Players-Lasky.<ref name="McCarthy" />{{rp 42–44}} According to Hawks, a new set needed to be built quickly when the studios set designer was unavailable, so Hawks volunteered to do the job himself, much to Fairbanks satisfaction. He was next employed as a prop boy and general assistant on an unspecified film directed by Cecil B. DeMille. (Hawks never named the film in later interviews and DeMille made five films roughly in that time period).

By the end of April 1917 Hawks was working on Cecil B. DeMilles The Little American. (On this film he met and befriended the then 18-year-old Clapperboard slate boy James Wong Howe, who was to become one of Hollywoods most significant cinematographers.)<ref name="McCarthy" />{{rp 42–44}} Hawks then worked on the Mary Pickford film The Little Princess (1917 film) The Little Princess, directed by Marshall Neilan. According to Hawks, Neilan did not show up to work one day, so the resourceful Hawks offered to direct a scene himself, to which Pickford consented.<ref name="McCarthy" />{{rp 44}}<ref name="Breivold">{{cite book last1=Breivold first1=Scott title=Howard Hawks: Interviews date=February 2006 publisher=University Press of Mississippi isbn=978-1-57806-833-3 url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WMxmjwp1a10C&pg=PA74 accessdate=26 July 2016}}</ref>{{rp 74}}

Hawks began directing at age 21 after he and cinematographer Charles Rosher filmed a double exposure dream sequence with Mary Pickford. Hawks worked with Pickford and Neilan again on Amarilly of Clothes-Line Alley before joining the United States Army Air Service.

Hawks military records were destroyed in the National Personnel Records Center fire 1973 Military Archive Fire, so the only account of his military service is his own. According to Hawks, he spent 15 weeks in basic training at the University of California in Berkeley where he was trained to be a Commander (United States)#U.S. Air Force squadron commander in the air force. When Pickford visited Hawks at basic training, his superior officers were so impressed by the appearance of the celebrity that they promoted him to flight instructor and sent him to Texas to teach new recruits. Bored by this work, Hawks attempted to secure a transfer during the first half of 1918 and was eventually sent to Fort Monroe, Virginia. The Armistice with Germany Armistice was signed in November of that year, and Hawks was discharged as a Second Lieutenant#United States Second Lieutenant without having seen active duty.<ref name="McCarthy" />{{rp 45–47}}<ref name=Wakeman2/>

After the war, Hawks was eager to return to Hollywood. His brother, Kenneth Hawks, who had also served in the Air Force, graduated from Yale University in 1919, and the two of them moved to Hollywood together to pursue their careers. They quickly made friends with Hollywood insider (and fellow Ivy Leaguer) Allan Dwan.

Hawks landed his first important job when he used his familys wealth to loan money to studio head Jack L. Warner. Warner quickly paid back the loan and hired Hawks as a producer to "oversee" the making of a new Serial film series of short films one-reel comedies starring the Italian comedian Monty Banks. Hawks later stated that he personally directed "three or four" of the shorts, though no documentation exists to confirm the claim. The films were profitable, but Hawks soon left to form his own production company using his familys wealth and connections to secure financing.

The production company, Associated Producers, was a joint venture between Hawks, Allan Dwan, Marshall Neilan, and director Allen Holubar, with a distribution deal with First National Pictures First National. The company made 14 films between 1920 and 1923, with 8 directed by Neilan, 3 by Dwan and 3 by Holubar.<ref name="McCarthy" />{{rp 49–52}} More of a "boys club" than a production company, the four men gradually drifted apart and went their separate ways in 1923, by which time Hawks had decided that he wanted to direct rather than produce.<ref name="McCarthy" />{{rp 56}}

Beginning in early 1920, Hawks lived in rented houses in Hollywood with the group of friends he was accumulating. This rowdy group of mostly macho, risk-taking men included his brother Kenneth Hawks, Victor Fleming, Jack Conway (filmmaker) Jack Conway, Harold Rosson, Richard Rosson (filmmaker) Richard Rosson, Arthur Rosson and Eddie Sutherland. During this time, Hawks first met Irving Thalberg, the frail and sickly vice-President in charge of production at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. (Eventually many of the young men in this group would become successful at MGM under Thalberg. Hawks admired his intelligence and sense of story.<ref name="McCarthy" />{{rp 57–58}}) Hawks also became friends with barn stormers and pioneer aviators at Rogers Airport in Los Angeles, getting to know men like Moye Stephens.

In 1923, Famous Players-Lasky president Jesse Lasky was looking for a new Production Editor in the story department of his studio and Thalberg suggested Hawks.<ref name=Wakeman2/> Hawks accepted and was immediately put in charge of over 40 productions, including several literary acquisitions of stories by Joseph Conrad, Jack London and Zane Grey. Hawks worked on the scripts for all of the films produced, but he had his first official screenplay credit in 1924 on Tiger Love.<ref name="McCarthy" />{{rp 59–60}} Hawks was the Story Editor at Famous Players (later Paramount Pictures) for almost two years, occasionally editing such films as Heritage of the Desert (1924 film) Heritage of the Desert.

Hawks signed a new one-year contract with Famous-Players in the fall of 1924. He broke his contract to become a story editor for Thalberg at MGM, having secured a promise from Thalberg to make him a director within a year. In 1925, when Thalberg hesitated to keep his promise, Hawks broke his contract at MGM and left.<ref name="McCarthy" />{{rp 60–63}}

==Career as a film director==

===Silent films: 1925–1929===
In October 1925, Sol Wurtzel, William Fox (producer) William Foxs studio superintendent at the 20th Century Fox Fox Film Corporation, invited Hawks to join his company with the promise of letting Hawks direct. Over the next three years, Hawks directed his first eight films (six silent, two "sound films talkies").<ref name=Wakeman2/>  (A few months after joining Fox, Kenneth Hawks was also hired and eventually became one of Foxs top production supervisors.)<ref name="McCarthy" />{{rp 64–65}} Hawks reworked the scripts of most of the films he directed without always taking official credit for his work. He also worked on the scripts for Honesty – The Best Policy in 1926<ref name="McCarthy" />{{rp 71–74}} and Joseph von Sternbergs Underworld (1927 film) Underworld in 1927, famous for being one of the first gangster films.<ref name="McCarthy" />{{rp 76}}

Also at this time in 1926, Hawks was introduced to Athole Shearer by his friend Victor Fleming, who was dating Atholes sister Norma Shearer. Atholes first marriage to writer John Ward had been unhappy. She and Hawks began dating throughout 1927, which led Shearer to ask Ward for a divorce in 1928. Shearer had a young son with Ward named Peter.<ref name="McCarthy" />{{rp 78–81}} Hawks and Athole Shearer married on May 28, 1928, and they honeymooned in Hawaii.<ref name="McCarthy" />{{rp 95–96}} Hawks and Shearer had their first child, David Hawks.<ref name="McCarthy" />{{rp 105}}

Hawks contract with Fox ended in May 1929, and he never again signed a long-term contract with a major studio. He managed to remain an independent producer-director for the rest of his long career.<ref name=Wakeman2/> In October 1929,

The Road to Glory (1926)

Hawks first film The Road to Glory was based on a 35-page treatment that Hawks wrote and is one of only two Hawks works that are lost films. The film starred May McAvoy as a young woman who is gradually going blind and tries to spare the two men in her life from the burden of her illness. The two men are her boyfriend Rockliffe Fellowes and her father Ford Sterling, with Leslie Fenton playing the greedy rich man whom she agrees to live with in order to get away from her father and lover. The film contained religious iconography and messages that would never again be seen in a Hawks film. It was shot from December 1925 to January 1926 and premiered in April. It received good reviews from film critics. In later interviews, Hawks said, "It didnt have any fun in it. It was pretty bad. I dont think anybody enjoyed it except a few critics." Hawks was dissatisfied with the film after being certain that dramatic films would establish his reputation, but realized what he had done wrong when Sol Wurtzel told Hawks, "Look, youve shown you can make a picture, but for Gods sake, go out and make entertainment."<ref name="McCarthy" />{{rp 65–68}}

Fig Leaves (1926)

Immediately after completing The Road to Glory, Hawks began writing his next film, Fig Leaves, his first (and, until 1935, only) comedy. The film portrays a married couple by juxtaposing them in the Garden of Eden and in modern New York City. The Garden of Eden humorously depicts Adam and Eve awoken by a Flintstones-like coconut alarm clock and Adam reading the morning news on giant stone tablets. In the modern day, the biblical serpent is replaced by Eves gossiping neighbor and Eve becomes a sexy flapper and fashion model when Adam is at work. The film starred George OBrien (actor) George OBrien as Adam and Olive Borden as Eve and received positive reviews, particularly for the art direction and costume designs. It was released in July 1926 and was Hawks first hit as a director. Although he mainly dismissed his early work, Hawks praised this film in later interviews.<ref name="McCarthy" />{{rp 69–71}}

Paid to Love (1927)

Paid to Love is notable in Hawks filmography as being the only time that he made a highly stylized, experimental film. He attempted to imitate the style of German film director F. W. Murnau, who had recently made The Last Laugh (1924 film) The Last Laugh and Sunrise (film) Sunrise and was the most critically acclaimed director in Hollywood. Hawks film includes atypical tracking shots, expressionistic lighting and stylistic film editing that was inspired by German Expressionism German Expressionist cinema. In a later interview, Hawks commented "It isnt my type of stuff, at least I got it over in a hurry. You know the idea of wanting the camera to do those things: Now the cameras somebodys eyes." Hawks worked on the script with Seton I. Miller, with whom he would go on to collaborate on seven more films. The film stars George OBrien (actor) George OBrien as the introverted Crown Prince Michael, William Powell as his happy-go-lucky brother and Virginia Valli as Michaels flapper love interest Dolores. The characters played by Valli and OBrien anticipate those found in later films by Hawks: a sexually aggressive showgirl, who is an early prototype of the "Hawksian woman", and a shy man disinterested in sex, found in later roles played by Cary Grant and Gary Cooper. Paid to Love was completed by September 1926, but remained unreleased until July 1927, when it was financially unsuccessful.<ref name="McCarthy" />{{rp 72–75}}

Cradle Snatchers (1927)

Cradle Snatchers was based on a 1925 hit stage play by Russell G. Medcraft and Norma Mitchell about three unhappy, middle-aged housewives who teach their adulterous husbands a lesson by starting affairs with college-aged young men during the jazz age. The film starred Louise Fazenda, Dorothy Phillips and Ethel Wales and was shot in early 1927. The film was released in May 1927 and was a minor hit. For many years it was believed to be a lost film until film director Peter Bogdanovich discovered a print in 20th Century Foxs film vaults, although the print was missing part of reel three and all of reel four.<ref name="McCarthy" />{{rp 76–78}}

Fazil (1928)

In March 1927, Hawks signed a new one-year, three-picture contract with Fox and was assigned to direct Fazil, based on the play LInsoumise by Pierre Frondaie. Hawks again worked with Seton Miller on the script about a Middle Eastern prince who has an affair with a Parisienne showgirl and cast Charles Farrell as the prince and Greta Nissen as Fabienne. Hawks went both over schedule and over budget on the film, which began a rift between him and Sol Wurtzel that would eventually lead to Hawks leaving Fox. The film was finished in August 1927, though it was not released until June 1928.<ref name="McCarthy" />{{rp 84–86}}

A Girl in Every Port (1928)

File:A Girl in Every Port poster.jpg thumb left A Girl in Every Port poster
A Girl in Every Port (1928 film) A Girl in Every Port is considered by film scholars to be the most important film of Hawks silent career. It is the first of his films to utilize many of the Hawksian themes and characters that would define much of his subsequent work. It was his first "love story between two men," with two men bonding over their duty, skills and careers, who consider their friendship to be more important than their relationships with women. Hawks wrote the original story and developed the screenplay with James Kevin McGuinness and Seton Miller. In the film Victor McLaglen and Robert Armstrong (actor) Robert Armstrong play two merchant seamen who are archrivals when it comes to women, with McLaglen constantly finding Armstrongs tattoo on the women that he is attempting to seduce. Eventually the two rivals become friends. Louise Brooks plays the cabaret singer with whom the two men fall in love. The film was shot from October to December 1927 and released in February 1928. It was successful in the US, and a hit in Europe where Louise Brooks was developing a cult following.<ref name="McCarthy" />{{rp 86–91}} In France, Henri Langlois called Hawks "the Walter Gropius Gropius of the cinema" and Swiss novelist and poet Blaise Cendrars said that the film "definitely marked the first appearance of contemporary cinema."<ref name="McCarthy" />{{rp 92}} Hawks went over budget once again with this film, though, and his relationship with Sol Wurtzel deteriorated. After an advance screening that received positive reviews, Wurtzel told Hawks, "This is the worst picture Fox has made in years."<ref name="McCarthy" />{{rp 91}}

The Air Circus (1928)

The Air Circus is Hawks first film centered around aviation, one of his early passions. In 1928, Charles Lindbergh was the worlds most famous person and Wings (1927 film) Wings was one of the most popular films of the year. Wanting to capitalize on the countrys aviation craze, Fox immediately bought Hawks original story for The Air Circus, a variation of the male friendship plot of A Girl in Every Port about two young pilots. Officially, the original story is credited to Graham Baker and Andrew Bennison, while the screenplay was written by Seton Miller and Norman Z. McLeod. In the film, Arthur Lake (actor) Arthur Lake and David Rollins play two eager young pilots at flight school who compete over their flight instructors aviatrix sister, played by Sue Carol. The film was shot from April to June 1928, but Fox ordered an additional 15 minutes of dialogue footage in order that the film could compete with the new "sound films talkies" being released. Hawks hated the new dialogue written by Hugh Herbert and he refused to participate in the re-shoots. The film was released in September 1928 and was a moderate hit. It is one of two films directed by Hawks that are lost films.<ref name="McCarthy" />{{rp 92–94}}

Trents Last Case (1929)

Trents Last Case (1929 film) Trents Last Case is an adaptation of British author E. C. Bentleys Trents Last Case 1913 novel of the same name, which had already been adapted for cinema Trents Last Case (1920 film) in England in 1920. Hawks considered the novel to be "one of the greatest detective stories of all time" and was eager to make it his first sound film. He cast Raymond Griffith in the lead role of Phillip Trent. Griffiths throat had been damaged by poison gas during World War I and his voice was a hoarse whisper, prompting Hawks to later state, "I thought he ought to be great in talking pictures because of that voice." However, after shooting only a few scenes, Fox shut Hawks down and ordered him to make a silent film, both because of Griffiths voice and because they only owned the legal rights to make a silent film. The film did have a musical score and synchronized sound effects, but no dialogue. Due to the failing business of silent films, it was never released in the US and only briefly screened in England where film critics hated it. The film was believed lost until the mid-1970s and was screened for the first time in the US at a Hawks retrospective in 1974. Hawks was in attendance of the screening and attempted to have the only print of the film destroyed.<ref name="McCarthy" />{{rp 97–101}}

===Early sound films: 1930–1934===
By 1930, Hollywood was in upheaval over the coming of "talkies" and the careers of many actors and directors were ruined. Hollywood studios were recruiting stage actors and directors that they believed were better suited for sound films. After having worked in the industry for 14 years and directed many financially successful films, Hawks found himself having to prove himself an asset to the studios once again. Leaving Fox on sour terms didnt help his reputation, but Hawks was one of the few people in Hollywood who never backed down from fights with studio heads. After several months of unemployment, Hawks renewed his career with his first sound film in 1930.<ref name="McCarthy" />{{rp 102}}

On January 2, 1930, Hawks brother Kenneth Hawks died while shooting the film Such Men Are Dangerous.<ref name="McCarthy" />{{rp 106–109}} Kenneths career as a director had been gathering momentum after his debut film Big Time (1929 film) Big Time in 1929. This sound film starred Lee Tracy and Mae Clarke and was an early example of the "fast-talking" sound films that would later become one of Howard Hawks signatures.<ref name="McCarthy" />{{rp 100–101}} Such Men Are Dangerous was based on the life Alfred Lowenstein, a Belgian captain who either jumped or fell out of his plane in 1928. On January 2, Kenneth Hawks and his crew flew three aircraft (two with cameras, one with a stunt actor) over Santa Monica Bay when the two camera aircraft crashed into each other, killing 10 men. The crash was the first major on-set accident in Hollywood history and made national news.

The Dawn Patrol (1930)

File:Dawn-Patrol-1930-Poster.jpg thumb The Dawn Patrol movie poster
Hawks first all sound film was The Dawn Patrol (1930 film) The Dawn Patrol, based on an original story by John Monk Saunders and (unofficially) Hawks. Saunders was a flight instructor during World War I and had written Wings (1927 film) Wings. He was considered one of the most talented writers in Hollywood and was often compared to F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway. Accounts vary on who came up with the idea of the film, but Hawks and Saunders developed the story together and tried to sell it to several studios before First National agreed to produce it.<ref name="McCarthy" />{{rp 102–105}} Saunders received solo screen credit for the original story and won an Academy Award for Best Story in 1930. The screenplay was written by Hawks, Seton Miller and Dan Totheroh and starred Richard Barthelmess and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. Shooting began in late February 1930, about the same time that Howard Hughes was finally finishing his epic World War I aviation epic Hells Angels (film) Hells Angels, which had been in production since September 1927. Shrewdly, Hawks began to hire many of the aviation experts and cameramen that had been employed by Hughes, including Elmer Dyer, Harry Reynolds and Ira Reed. When Hughes found out about the rival film, he did everything he could to sabotage The Dawn Patrol. He harassed Hawks and other studio personal, hired a spy that was quickly caught and finally sued First National for copyright infringement. Hughes eventually dropped the lawsuit in late 1930—he and Hawks had become good friends during the legal battle. In the film, Barthelmess and Fairbanks play two Royal Flying Corps pilots during World War I who deal with the pressure of wartime combat and constant death by drinking and fighting with their commanding officer. Filming was finished in late May 1930 and it premiered in July, setting a first-week box office record at the Winter Garden Theatre in New York. The film became one of the biggest hits of 1930.<ref name="McCarthy" />{{rp 111–115}}

The Criminal Code (1931)

Hawks did not get along with Warner Brothers executive Hal B. Wallis and his contract allowed him to be loaned out to other studios. Hawks took the opportunity to accept a directing offer from Harry Cohn at Columbia Pictures: The Criminal Code, based on a successful play by Martin Flavin. Hawks and Seton Miller worked on the script with Flavin for a month and filming began in September 1930. The film starred Walter Huston, Phillips Holmes, Constance Cummings and Boris Karloff. Huston plays a prison warden who wants to reform the conditions of the inmates and Holmes plays a wrongly convicted prisoner who learns about the "code" of not ratting on other inmates. Hawks called Huston "the greatest actor I ever worked with".<ref name="McCarthy" />{{rp 118–119}} Hawks also worked with his old friend James Wong Howe for the first time as a cinematographer.

Scarface (1932)

In 1930, Howard Hughes hired Hawks to direct Scarface (1932 film) Scarface, a gangster film loosely based on the life of Chicago mobster Al Capone. The film starred Paul Muni in the title role, with memorable supporting performances from George Raft, Boris Karloff, and Osgood Perkins. The film was completed in September 1931, but the censorship of the Hays Code prevented it from being released as Hawks and Hughes had originally intended. The two men fought, negotiated and made compromises with the Hays Office for over a year, until the film was eventually released in 1932, after such other pivotal early gangster films as The Public Enemy and Little Caesar (film) Little Caesar. Scarface was the first film in which Hawks worked with screenwriter Ben Hecht, who became a close friend and collaborator for 20 years.<ref name=Wakeman2/>

The Crowd Roars (1932)

After filming was complete on Scarface, Hawks left Hughes to fight the legal battles and returned to First National to fulfill his contract, this time with producer Darryl F. Zanuck. For his next film, Hawks wanted to make a film about his childhood passion: car racing. The Crowd Roars (1932 film) The Crowd Roars is loosely based on the play The Barker: A Play of Carnival Life by Kenyon Nicholson. Hawks developed the script with Seton Miller for their eighth and final collaboration and the script was by Miller, Kubec Glasmon, John Bright (screenwriter) John Bright and Niven Busch. The film starred James Cagney, Eric Linden, Joan Blondell and Ann Dvorak. In the film, Cagney plays a race car driver who tries to "protect" his younger brother Linden, who is also a driver, from being distracted by his girlfriend, Blondell. At the same time, Cagney must hide his own neurotic girlfriend, played by Dvorak, from his younger brother. Blondell and Dvorak were initially cast in each others roles but swapped after a few days of shooting. Shooting began on December 7, 1931 at Legion Ascot Speedway and wrapped on February 1, 1932.

Later in 1932, he directed Tiger Shark (film) Tiger Shark starring Edward G. Robinson as a tuna fisherman. In these early films, Hawks established the prototypical "Hawksian Man", which film critic Andrew Sarris described as "upheld by an instinctive professionalism."<ref name=Wakeman2/> Tiger Shark demonstrated Hawks ability to incorporate touches of humor into dramatic, tense, and even tragic story lines.<ref name="McCarthy" />{{rp 172}}

Today We Live (1933)

In 1933, Hawks signed a three-picture deal at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, the first of which was Today We Live in 1933, starring Joan Crawford and Gary Cooper. This World War I film was based on a short story by author William Faulkner, with whom Hawks would remain friends for over 20 years.<ref name="McCarthy" />{{rp 173–187}}

Hawks next two films at MGM were the boxing drama The Prizefighter and the Lady and the biographical film bio-pic Viva Villa!, starring Wallace Beery as Mexican Revolutionary leader Pancho Villa. Studio interference on both films led Hawks to walk out on his MGM contract without completing either film himself.<ref name=Wakeman2/>

In 1934, Hawks went to Columbia Pictures to make his first Screwball comedy film screwball comedy, Twentieth Century (film) Twentieth Century, starring John Barrymore and Hawks distant cousin Carole Lombard. It was based on a stage play by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur and, along with Frank Capras It Happened One Night (released the same year), is considered to be the defining film of the screwball comedy genre. In 1935, Hawks made Barbary Coast (film) Barbary Coast with Edward G. Robinson and Miriam Hopkins. In 1936, he made the aviation adventure Ceiling Zero with James Cagney and Pat OBrien (actor) Pat OBrien. Also in 1936, Hawks began filming Come and Get It (1936 film) Come and Get It, starring Edward Arnold (actor) Edward Arnold, Joel McCrea, Frances Farmer and Walter Brennan. But he was fired by Samuel Goldwyn in the middle of shooting and the film was completed by William Wyler.<ref name=Wakeman2/>

In 1938, Hawks made the screwball comedy Bringing Up Baby for RKO Pictures. It starred Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn and has been called "the screwiest of the screwball comedies" by film critic Andrew Sarris. Grant plays a near-sighted paleontologist who suffers one humiliation after another due to the lovestruck socialite played by Hepburn.<ref name=Wakeman2/> Hawks artistic direction for Bringing Up Baby revolved around the raw natural chemistry between Grant and Hepburn. With Grant portraying the paleontologist and Hepburn as an heiress, the roles only add to the movies purpose of disintegrating the line between the real and the imaginary.<ref name="films of" />Bringing Up Baby was a box office flop when initially released and, subsequently, RKO fired Hawks due to extreme losses; however, the film has become regarded as one of Hawks masterpieces.<ref name="Laham">{{cite book last1=Laham first1=Nicholas title=Currents of Comedy on the American Screen: How Film and Television Deliver Different Laughs for Changing Times date=May 2009 publisher=McFarland isbn=9780786442645 pages=27–29 url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CsqL5zpWX7cC&pg=PA27 accessdate=8 September 2016}}</ref> Hawks followed this with the aviation drama Only Angels Have Wings, again starring Cary Grant and made in 1939 for Columbia Pictures.

In 1940, Hawks returned to the screwball comedy genre with His Girl Friday, starring Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell. The film was an adaptation of the hit Broadway play The Front Page by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur,<ref name="Wakeman2" /> which had already been made into a The Front Page (1931 film) film in 1931 and had also been reworked by the same screenwriters and transplanted to Rudyard Kiplings India for Gunga Din (film) Gunga Din in 1939.<ref name="Moss">{{cite book last1=Moss first1=Marilyn Ann title=Giant: George Stevens, a Life on Film date=August 2015 publisher=University of Wisconsin Press isbn=9780299204341 page=57 url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iPEhCJbul9QC&pg=PA57 accessdate=8 September 2016}}</ref> In 1941, Hawks made Sergeant York (film) Sergeant York, starring Gary Cooper as a pacifist farmer who becomes a decorated World War I soldier. This was the highest-grossing film of 1941 and won two Academy Awards (Academy Award for Best Actor Best Actor and Academy Award for Best Film Editing Best Editing), as well as earning Hawks his only nomination for Academy Award for Best Director Best Director. Later that year, Hawks worked with Cooper again for Ball of Fire, which also starred Barbara Stanwyck. The film was written by Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett and is a playful take on Snow White Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Cooper plays a sheltered, intellectual linguist who is writing an encyclopedia with six other scientists, and hires street-wise Stanwyck to help them with modern slang terms. In 1941, Hawks began work on the Howard Hughes-produced (and later directed) film The Outlaw, based on the life of Billy the Kid and starring Jane Russell. Hawks completed initial shooting of the film in early 1941, but due to perfectionism and battles with the Hollywood Production Code, Hughes continued to re-shoot and re-edit the film until 1943, when it was finally released with Hawks uncredited as director.<ref name=Wakeman2/>

After making the World War II film Air Force (film) Air Force in 1943 starring John Garfield, Hawks did two films with real-life lovers Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. To Have and Have Not (film) To Have and Have Not, made in 1944, stars Bogart, Bacall and Walter Brennan and is based on a novel by Ernest Hemingway. Hawks was a close friend of Hemingway and made a bet with the author that he could make a good film out of Hemingways "worst book." Hawks, William Faulkner and Jules Furthman collaborated on the script about an American fishing boat captain working out of French Martinique in the Caribbean and various situations of espionage after the Fall of France in 1940. Bogart and Bacall fell in love on the set of the film and married soon afterwards. To Have and Have Not has been critiqued as having a "rambling, slapped-together feel" that contribute to an overall clumsy and dull movie.<ref name="films of">{{cite book last1=Willis first1=Donald C. title=The Films of Howard Hawks date=1975 publisher=Scarecrow Press location=Metuchen, NJ}}</ref>{{rp 60}} The film, however, has also been enjoyed for its romantic plot and has been compared to Casablanca in its feel.<ref name="focus on">{{cite book last1=McBride first1=Joseph title=Focus on Howard Hawks date=1972 publisher=Prentice-Hall location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ}}</ref>{{rp 2}} The greatest strength of the movie has been said to come from its atmosphere and use of wit that really plays on the strengths of Bacall and helps the movie solidify the theme of beauty in perpetual opposition.<ref name="films of" />{{rp 75}}Hawks reteamed with Bogart and Bacall in 1946 with The Big Sleep (1946 film) The Big Sleep, based on the Philip Marlowe detective novel by Raymond Chandler.<ref name=Wakeman2/>

In 1948, Hawks made Red River (1948 film) Red River, an epic western reminiscent of Mutiny on the Bounty starring John Wayne and Montgomery Clift in his first film. Later that year, Hawks remade his earlier film Ball of Fire as A Song Is Born, this time starring Danny Kaye and Virginia Mayo. This version follows the same plot but pays more attention to popular jazz music and includes such jazz legends as Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman, Louis Armstrong, Lionel Hampton, and Benny Carter playing themselves. In 1949, Hawks reteamed with Cary Grant in the screwball comedy I Was a Male War Bride, also starring Ann Sheridan.<ref name=Wakeman2/>

In 1951, Hawks produced, and some believe essentially directed, a science-fiction film, The Thing from Another World. Director John Carpenter stated: "And lets get the record straight. The movie was directed by Howard Hawks. Verifiably directed by Howard Hawks. He let his editor, Christian Nyby, take credit.

In 1953, Hawks made Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953 film) Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, which featured Marilyn Monroe famously singing "Diamonds Are a Girls Best Friend." The film starred Monroe and Jane Russell as two gold-digging, cabaret-performer best friends that many critics argue is the only female version of his celebrated "buddy film" genre that he made. In 1955, Hawks shot a film atypical within the context of his other work, Land of the Pharaohs, which is a sword-and-sandal epic about ancient Egypt that stars Jack Hawkins and Joan Collins. The film was Hawks final collaboration with longtime friend William Faulkner before the authors death. In 1959, Hawks worked with John Wayne in Rio Bravo (movie) Rio Bravo, also starring Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson, and Walter Brennan as four lawmen "defending the fort" of their local jail in which a local criminal is awaiting a trial while his family attempt to break him out.

In 1962, Hawks made Hatari!, again with John Wayne, who plays a wild animals catcher in Africa. In 1964, Hawks made his final comedy, Mans Favorite Sport?, starring Rock Hudson (since Cary Grant felt he was too old for the role) and Paula Prentiss. Hawks then returned to his childhood passion for car races with Red Line 7000 in 1965, featuring a young James Caan in his first leading role. Hawks final two films were both Western remakes of Rio Bravo starring John Wayne. In 1966, Hawks directed El Dorado (1966 film) El Dorado, starring Wayne, Robert Mitchum, and Caan, which was released the following year.

Hawks was a versatile director whose career includes comedies, dramas, gangster films, science fiction, film noir, and Westerns. Hawks own functional definition of what constitutes a "good movie" is characteristic of his no-nonsense style: "Three great scenes, no bad ones."<ref name="Breivold" />{{rp 63}}<ref name=historyfilm/> Hawks also defined a good director as "someone who doesnt annoy you."<ref name="Huffington Post">{{cite news last1=Farr first1=John title=Genius Uncovered: The Film Legacy of Howard Hawk url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-farr/genius-uncovered-the-time_b_1533671.html accessdate=26 July 2016 work=Huffington Post date=5 Apr 2013}}</ref> In Hawks own words, his directing style is based on being enjoyable and straightforward.<ref name="hawks on hawks" >{{cite book last1=McBride first1=Joseph title=Hawks on Hawks date=1982 publisher=University of California Press location=Berkeley, California}}</ref>{{rp 2}} His style was very actor-focused and he made it a point to take as few shots as possible, thereby preserving an inherent and natural humor for his comedic pieces.<ref name="hawks on hawks" />{{rp 40}}

While Hawks was not sympathetic to feminism, he popularized the Hawksian woman archetype, a portrayal of women in more strong, less effeminate roles. Such an emphasis had never been done in the 1920s and therefore was seen to be a rarity and, according to Naomi Wise, has been cited as a prototype of the Post-feminism post-feminist movement.<ref name="american artist">{{cite book editor1-last=Hillier editor1-first=Jim editor2-last=Wollen editor2-first=Peter title=Howard Hawks: American Artist date=April 1997 publisher=British Film Institute isbn=978-0-85170-593-4 pages=111–119}}</ref><ref name="hawks on hawks" />{{rp 70}} Another notable theme carried throughout his work included the relationship of morality and human interaction.

Despite Hawks work in a variety of Hollywood genres, he still retained an independent sensibility. Film critic David Thomson (film critic) David Thomson wrote of Hawks: "Far from being the meek purveyor of Hollywood forms, he always chose to turn them upside down. To Have and Have Not and The Big Sleep, ostensibly an adventure and a thriller, are really love stories. Rio Bravo, apparently a Western – everyone wears a cowboy hat – is a comedy conversation piece. The ostensible comedies are shot through with exposed emotions, with the subtlest views of the sex war, and with a wry acknowledgment of the incompatibility of men and women."<ref name="Thomson 1994">{{cite book last1=Thomson first1=David title=A Biographical Dictionary of Film date=November 1994 publisher=Knopf isbn=9780679755647 page=322 edition=3}}</ref>  David Boxwell argues that the filmmakers body of work "has been accused of a historical and adolescent escapism, but Hawks fans rejoice in his oeuvres remarkable avoidance of Hollywoods religiosity, bathos, flag-waving, and sentimentality.<ref>Boxwell, David.

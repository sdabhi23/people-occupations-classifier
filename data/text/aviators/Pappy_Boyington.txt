Gregory "Pappy" Boyington (December 4, 1912&nbsp;– January 11, 1988) was an American combat Pilot (aircraft) pilot who was a United States Marine Corps Fighter aircraft fighter flying ace ace during World War II. He received both the Medal of Honor and the Navy Cross (United States) Navy Cross.

Boyington was initially a US Marine Corps aviator with the Pacific fleet before being recruited by the legendary American Volunteer Group "Flying Tigers" (1st American Volunteer Group) in the Republic of China Air Force in Burma at the end of 1941 and part of 1942, during the Second Sino-Japanese War military conflict between Republic of China China and Empire of Japan Japan, and the beginning of World War II.

In September 1942, he rejoined the Marine Corps. In early 1943, he deployed to the South Pacific area South Pacific and began flying combat missions as a Marine Vought F4U Corsair F4U Corsair fighter pilot. In September 1943, he took command of Marine fighter squadron VMA-214 VMF-214 ("Black Sheep"). In January 1944, Boyington, outnumbered by Japanese Mitsubishi A6M Zero "Zero" planes, was shot down into the Pacific Ocean after downing one of the enemy planes. He was captured by a Japanese submarine crew and was held as a prisoner of war for more than a year and a half. He was released shortly after the surrender of Japan, and a few days before the official surrender documents were signed.

The television series Baa Baa Black Sheep (TV series) Baa Baa Black Sheep was inspired by Boyington and his men in the "Black Sheep" squadron. It ran for two seasons in the late 1970s.

After graduation from high school in 1930, Boyington attended the University of Washington in Seattle, where he was a member of the Army Reserve Officers Training Corps Army ROTC and joined the Lambda Chi Alpha Fraternities and sororities in North America fraternity.<ref name=Whoswho/> He was on the Washington Huskies Husky wrestling and swimming teams, and for a time he held the Pacific Northwest Intercollegiate middleweight wrestling title. He spent his summers working in Washington in a mining camp and at a logging camp, and with the Coeur dAlene Fire Protective Association in road construction. He graduated in 1934 with a Bachelor of Science B.S. in Aerospace engineering aeronautical engineering. Boyington married shortly after graduation and worked as a Technical drawing draftsman and Engineering engineer for Boeing in Seattle.<ref name=Whoswho/>

In the spring of 1935, he applied for flight training under the Aviation Cadet Training Program (USN)#Naval Aviation Cadet Act (1935) Aviation Cadet Act, but he discovered that it excluded married men.<ref>{{cite book author=Gamble, Bruce title=Black Sheep One: The Life of Gregory "Pappy" Boyington page=49}}</ref> Boyington had grown up as Gregory Hallenbeck, and assumed his stepfather, Ellsworth J.

When he obtained a copy of his birth certificate, however, he learned that his father was actually Charles Boyington, a dentist, and that his parents had divorced when he was an infant.<ref name=mmamffwo/> As there was no record of any Gregory Boyington had ever been married, he enrolled as United States Marine Corps U.S. Marine Corps Aviation Cadet Training Program (USN) aviation cadet using that name.<ref>{{cite book author=Gamble, Bruce title=Black Sheep One: The Life of Gregory "Pappy" Boyington  page=51}}</ref>

==Military career==
Boyington had begun his military training in college as a member of Army ROTC and became a cadet captain. He was Commissioned officer commissioned a Second lieutenant#United States second lieutenant in the United States Army U.S. Army Coast Artillery Reserve in June 1934, and then served two months of active duty with the 630th Coast Artillery at Fort Worden, Washington.{{citation needed date=March 2017}}

===United States Marine Corps===
On June 13, 1935, he managed to transfer to the United States Marine Corps Reserve U.S. Marine Corps Reserve. He returned to inactive duty on July 16 that year.<ref name=Whoswho/> On February 18, 1936, Boyington accepted an appointment as an aviation cadet in the USMCR Marine Corps Reserve. He was assigned to Naval Air Station Pensacola Naval Air Station, Pensacola, Florida, for flight training. Boyington was designated a Naval aviation Naval Aviator on March 11, 1937, then transferred to Marine Corps Base Quantico Quantico, Virginia, for duty with Aircraft One, Fleet Marine Force. He was discharged from the Marine Corps Reserve on July 1, 1937 in order to accept a second lieutenants commission in the regular United States Marine Corps Marine Corps the following day.<ref name=Whoswho/>

Boyington attended The Basic School in Philadelphia from July 1938 to January 1939. On completion of the course, he was assigned to the 2nd Marine Aircraft Group at the NAS San Diego San Diego Naval Air Station. He took part in fleet problems off the aircraft carriers {{USS Lexington CV-2 6}} and {{USS Yorktown CV-5 6}}. Promoted to lieutenant#United States first lieutenant on November 4, 1940, Boyington returned to Pensacola as an instructor in December.<ref name=Whoswho/>

===Flying Tigers===
Boyington resigned his commission in the Marine Corps on August 26, 1941, to accept a position with the Central Aircraft Manufacturing Company Central Aircraft Manufacturing Company (CAMCO). CAMCO was a civilian firm that contracted to staff a Special Air Unit to defend China and the Burma Road. This later became known as the American Volunteer Group (AVG), the famed Flying Tigers in Burma. During his time with the Tigers, Boyington became a flight leader. He was frequently in trouble with the commander of the outfit, Claire Chennault. Boyington was officially credited with 2 Japanese aircraft destroyed in the air and 1.5 on the ground, but AVG records suggest that one additional ground "kill" may have been due to him.{{cn date=October 2017}} (He afterward claimed six victories as a Tiger, each kill detailed in his autobiography, but there is no substantiation for that figure, and aircraft destroyed on the ground normally do not count as victories.) In April 1942, he broke his contract with the American Volunteer Group and returned on his own to the United States.

===Return to the Marine Corps===
On September 29, 1942, he rejoined the Marine Corps and managed to gain a Major (United States) majors commission.<ref name=Whoswho/> The Marine Corps needed experienced combat pilots and in early 1943, he was assigned to Marine Aircraft Group 11 of the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing and deployed to the South Pacific as Executive Officer of VMF-122 Marine Fighter Squadron 122 operating from Guadalcanal until April 1943. While assigned to VMF-122, Boyington did not gain any victories. He became commander of VMF-112 Marine Fighter Squadron 112 from July to August 1943. In September 1943, he became Commanding Officer (CO) of VMA-214 Marine Fighter Squadron 214, better known by its nickname, the "Black Sheep Squadron."<ref name=Whoswho/>

Boyington received the nickname "Gramps", because at age 31, he was a decade older than most of the Marines serving under him. The name "Gramps" was changed to "Pappy" in a variation on The Whiffenpoofs "The Whiffenpoof Song" whose new lyrics had been written by Paul "Moon" Mullen, one of his pilots, and this version was picked up by war correspondents.<ref name=Whoswho/>

Boyington is best known for his exploits in the Vought F4U Corsair in VMF-214. During periods of intense activity in the Russell Islands-New Georgia and Bougainville Island Bougainville-New Britain-New Ireland (island) New Ireland areas, Boyington added to his total almost daily. During his squadrons first tour of combat duty, he shot down 14 enemy fighter planes in 32 days. By December 27, his record had climbed to 25.<ref name=Whoswho/>

A typical feat was his attack on Kahili airdrome at the southern tip of Bougainville on October 17, 1943. Boyington and 24 fighters circled the field, where 60 hostile aircraft were based, goading the enemy into sending up a large force. In the fierce battle that followed, 20 enemy aircraft were shot down, while the Black Sheep returned to their base without loss.<ref name=Whoswho/>

Boyington’s squadron, flying from the island of Vella Lavella, offered to down a Japanese Zero for every baseball cap sent to them by major league players in the World Series. They received 20 caps and shot down more than that number of enemy aircraft.{{citation needed date=March 2017}}

On January 3, 1944, he tied World War I ace Eddie Rickenbackers record of 26 enemy planes destroyed, before he was himself shot down.<ref name=jinx26/><ref name=mbmia>{{cite news url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OKcLAAAAIBAJ&sjid=FVUDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6415%2C1070757  newspaper=The Evening Independent location=St. Petersburg, Florida agency=Associated Press title=Major Boyington, Marine air hero, missing in action date=January 7, 1944 page=9}}</ref><ref name=bsalrop>{{cite news url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=66YkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=uGkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2147%2C826249 newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette agency=Associated Press last=Hampson first=Fred title=Boyington still alive, rumor over Pacific date=May 23, 1944 page=5}}</ref>  Boyington himself claimed his total as 28, including the six kills he claimed with the Flying Tigers.

On that mission, forty-eight American fighters, including four planes from the Black Sheep Squadron, were sent on a sweep over Rabaul. Boyington was tactical commander of the flight and arrived over the target at eight oclock AM. He was seen to shoot down his 26th plane, but he then became mixed in the general melee of dogfighting planes and was not seen or heard from during the battle, nor did he return with his squadron. Boyingtons wingman, Captain George Ashmun, was killed in action.<ref name=Whoswho/>

In later years, Masajiro "Mike" Kawato claimed to have been the pilot who shot down Boyington. He described the combat in two books and numerous public appearances (often with Boyington), but this claim was eventually "disproven," though Kawato repeated his story until his death. Kawato was present during the action in which Boyington was shot down, as one of 70 Japanese fighters which engaged about 30 American fighters.<ref>[http://www.warbirdforum.com/kawato.htm "Kawato Masajiro: The man who didnt shoot down Pappy Boyington"], warbirdforum.com; retrieved April 11, 2006.</ref>

===Prisoner of war===
Following a determined but futile search, Boyington was declared missing in action (MIA).<ref name=bsalrop/> He had been picked up by a Japanese submarine and became a prisoner of war. (The submarine was sunk 13 days after picking him up.) According to Boyingtons autobiography, he was never accorded official P.O.W. status by the Japanese and his captivity was not reported to the Red Cross.<ref name=bmaralijp>{{cite news url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DhwKAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rUoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4203%2C4464174  newspaper=Ellensburg Daily Record agency=Associated Press title=Boyington, Marine ace, reported alive in Japan date=August 29, 1945 page=1}}</ref>

He spent the rest of the war, some 20 months, in Japanese internment prison camps. After being held temporarily at Rabaul and then Chuuk Lagoon Truk, where he survived the massive U.S. Navy raid known as "Operation Hailstone", he was transported first to Ōfuna (Prisoner of War Camp) Ōfuna and finally to Ōmori Ōmori Prison Camp near Tokyo.  During that time he was selected for temporary promotion to the rank of Lieutenant colonel (United States) lieutenant colonel. A fellow American prisoner of war was Medal of Honor recipient submarine captain Richard OKane.<ref name=Whoswho/> At Ōfuna Boyington was interned with the former Olympic distance runner and downed aviator lieutenant Louis Zamperini.<ref>As recounted by Boyington in his book Baa baa, black sheep.</ref>

On August 29, 1945,<ref name=bmaralijp/> after the atomic bombs and the Japanese capitulation, Boyington was liberated from Japanese custody at Omori Prison Camp. Boyington returned to the United States at Naval Air Station Alameda on September 12, 1945, where he was met by 21 former squadron members from VMF-214.<ref name=bwbhbsp/><ref name=pbmogohr>{{cite news  url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wSVSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=qXcDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6975%2C1122902  newspaper=Deseret News  location=Salt Lake City, Utah  agency=Associated Press  title=Pappy Boyington meets old gang on his return  date=September 12, 1945  page=5 }}</ref> That night a party for him was held at the St. Francis Hotel in downtown San Francisco that was covered by Life (magazine) Life Magazine in its issue Oct. 1, 1945.

The medal had been awarded by the late president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt Franklin D. Roosevelt in March 1944 and held in the capital until such time as he could receive it. On October 4, 1945, Boyington received the Navy Cross (United States) Navy Cross from the Commandant of the Marine Corps for the Rabaul raid. On October 5, "Nimitz Day," he and some other sailors and Marines who were also awarded the Medal of Honor, were presented their medals at the White House by President Harry S. Truman.<ref name=Whoswho/>

Following the receipt of his Medal of Honor and Navy Cross, Boyington made a Victory Bond Tour. Originally ordered to the Marine Corps Schools, Quantico, he was later directed to report to the Commanding General, Marine Air West Coast, Marine Corps Air Depot, Miramar, San Diego, California. He retired from the Marine Corps on August 1, 1947, and because he was specially commended for the performance of duty in actual combat, he was promoted to colonel.<ref name=Whoswho/>

==Later life==
Boyington was a tough, hard-living character known for being unorthodox. He was also a heavy drinker, which plagued him in the years after the war, and possibly contributed to his multiple divorces. He freely admitted that during the two years he spent as a P.O.W. his health improved, due to the enforced sobriety. He worked various civilian jobs, including refereeing and participating in professional wrestling matches.<ref name=Whoswho/>

===Author===
Boyington wrote his autobiography, Baa Baa Black Sheep, published in 1958.<ref name=birkpbmp>{{cite news url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NvdPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=VVUDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7564%2C139701 newspaper=Evening Independent location=St. Petersburg, Florida last=Cannel first=Ward agency=NEA title=Brass irk Pappy Boyington, famed Marine pilot of war date=October 2, 1958 page=3A}}</ref><ref>{{cite book author=Boyington, Gregory "Pappy" year=1958 title=Baa Baa BlackSheep  publisher=Wilson Press isbn=978-0686111092}}</ref> He wrote a novel about the American Volunteer Group AVG.

===TV series===
Many people know him from the mid-1970s television show Baa Baa Black Sheep (TV series) Baa Baa Black Sheep, a drama about the Black Sheep squadron based very loosely on Boyingtons memoir, with Boyington portrayed by Robert Conrad.<ref name=apbhonsr>{{cite news url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oBwiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=MGcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6845%2C3617103 newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune location=Sarasota, Florida agency=UPI title=Ace Pappy Boyington hero of new series date=April 25, 1976 page=5B}}</ref><ref name=bshdwb>{{cite news url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=f8swAAAAIBAJ&sjid=nQUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6939%2C3647492 newspaper=Ocala Star-Banner location=Ocala, Florida agency=Associated Press title=Black Sheep doing well: Boyington date=December 15, 1976 page=8B}}</ref> Like Chuck Yeager in The Right Stuff (film) The Right Stuff (1983), Pappy had a short walk-on role, as a visiting general for two episodes in the first season ("The Deadliest Enemy of All: Part 2" and "The Fastest Gun") and one episode in the second season ("Tenll Get You Five") of the show.<ref>http://www.orgsites.com/ny/port-jefferson-station-marines/MCVNewsletter2015_05.pdf</ref>

Many of Boyingtons men were irate over the show, charging it was mostly fiction and presented a glamorized portrayal of Boyington. On the television show, Boyington was depicted as owning a bull terrier dog, named "Meatball". However, he was heard commenting at a 1970s Experimental Aircraft Association air show book signing that if he did have a dog at the time, it wouldnt have been such "an ugly" dog. Boyington frequently told interviewers and audiences that the television series was fiction and only slightly related to fact, calling it "hogwash and Hollywood Bullshit hokum".<ref>{{cite magazine author=Bates, Tom title=Black Sheep of the South Pacific magazine=Soldier of Fortune (magazine) SOFs Action Series volume= II number=6: Valor date=December 1986 publisher= Omega Group, Ltd. pages=56–57}}</ref>

===Publicity===
While paintings and publicity photographs often show Boyington with aircraft number 86 "LuluBelle" covered in victory flags, he had not flown this in combat. In fact, he rarely flew the same aircraft more than a few times. Reportedly, he would choose the F4U in the worst shape, so that none of his pilots would be afraid to fly their own aircraft.<ref name=Whoswho/>

A publicity photo taken of Boyington in F4U-1A Corsair number 86 was taken at Espiritu Santo (code named BUTTON), in the New Hebrides on 26 November 1943. It was taken while VMF-214 was on R&R, between VMF-214s first and second combat tours with Boyington as the commanding officer.  Though Boyington claimed after the war that the name of the plane was "LuluBelle", according to Bruce Gambles analysis, it was most likely called "LucyBelle". VMF-214 had previously served two combat tours in the Solomon Islands before Boyington assumed command of the squadron.<ref name=Whoswho/>

===Museum Corsair===
He visited the Smithsonian Institutions National Air and Space Museum Paul E. Garber Preservation, Restoration, and Storage Facility, coincidentally just as the Museums F4U Corsair left the restoration shop. According to Museum docent docents who witnessed the occasion, Boyington climbed into the cockpit "for old times sake" and attempted to start the engine. He autographed the Corsair with a magic marker in one of the landing gear wells, saying, in effect, that it was a Corsair in the best condition hed ever seen. Years later that same Corsair hangs from the ceiling at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center NASM Dulles Annex, and Boyingtons autograph is visible from floor level to the sharp-eyed.<ref name=Whoswho/>

===TV appearance===
In 1957, he appeared as a guest contestant on the television panel show To Tell The Truth.<ref name=ToTellTruth>{{youtube oV3SAAtb3XY Greg "Pappy" Boyington on "To Tell The Truth"}}</ref> In 1976 Boyington appeared on NBCs Today (U.S. TV program) Today Show with actor Robert Conrad and was interviewed about the new NBC drama Baa Baa Black Sheep.<ref name=nyt>{{cite web url=http://mrdsneighborhood.com/2011/01/03/this-day-in-history-13-pappy-boyington-is-shot-down-over-the-pacific title=This Day in History date=January 3, 2011 website=mrdsneighborhood.com accessdate=November 6, 2015}}</ref>

Consistently outnumbered throughout successive hazardous flights over heavily defended hostile territory, Major Boyington struck at the enemy with daring and courageous persistence, leading his squadron into combat with devastating results to Japanese shipping, shore installations and aerial forces.  Resolute in his efforts to inflict crippling damage on the enemy, Major BOYINGTON led a formation of twenty-four fighters over Kahili on October 17,  and, persistently circling the airdrome where sixty hostile aircraft were grounded, boldly challenged the Japanese to send up planes.  Under his brilliant command, our fighters shot down twenty enemy craft in the ensuing action without the loss of a single ship.  A superb airman and determined fighter against overwhelming odds,  Major BOYINGTON personally destroyed 26 of the many Japanese planes shot down by his squadron and by his forceful leadership developed the combat readiness in his command which was a distinctive factor in the Allied aerial achievements in this vitally strategic area.

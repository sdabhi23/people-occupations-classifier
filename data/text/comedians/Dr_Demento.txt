Barret Eugene "Barry" Hansen (born April 2, 1941),<ref name="offbio">{{cite web url=http://www.drdemento.com/dr-bio.html  title=The Online Internet Site for Information on Dr. Demento music, songs, lyrics and chat  publisher=Drdemento.com  date=  accessdate=2014-03-30}}</ref> better known as Dr. Demento, is an American radio broadcaster and record collector specializing in novelty songs, comedy, and strange or unusual recordings dating from the early days of phonograph records to the present.

Hansen created the Demento persona in 1970 while working at Los Angeles, California Los Angeles station KPPC (defunct) KPPC-FM.<ref name="offbio" />  After Hansen played "Transfusion (song) Transfusion" by Nervous Norvus on the radio, DJ "The Obscene" Steven Clean said that Hansen had to be "demented" to play that.  Thereafter, the name stuck.  His weekly show went into syndication in 1974<ref name="offbio" /> and from 1978 to 1992 was syndicated by the Westwood One (1976–2011) Westwood One Radio Network. Broadcast syndication of the show ended on June 6, 2010, but the show continues to be produced weekly in an online version.

Hansen has a degree in ethnomusicology, and has written magazine articles and liner notes on recording artists outside of the novelty genre. He is credited with introducing new generations of listeners to artists of the early and middle 20th century whom they might not have otherwise discovered, such as Harry McClintock, Spike Jones, Benny Bell, Yogi Yorgesson, Stan Freberg, and Tom Lehrer, as well as with bringing parodist "Weird Al" Yankovic to national attention.

== Early life ==
Hansen was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the son of an amateur pianist. He claims to have started his vast record collection as early as age 12, when he found "that a local thrift store had thousands of old 78 RPM records for sale at 5 cents each."<ref name="offbio" /> He attended Reed College in Portland, Oregon, where he was promoted to Program Director of KXRY KRRC in 1960 and General Manager in 1961. He wrote his senior thesis on Alban Bergs opera Wozzeck and Claude Debussys opera Pelléas et Mélisande (opera) Pelléas et Mélisande. He graduated in 1963, and later studied at University of California, Los Angeles UCLA, from which he earned a masters degree in folklore and ethnomusicology.

After earning his masters degree, he lived for two years "in a big house on a hill" in Topanga Canyon with members of the rock band Spirit (band) Spirit.  He also served briefly as a roadie for Spirit, and for Canned Heat, before being hired as an A&R man, or talent scout, for Specialty Records. The Doctor began his weekly radio show while working for Specialty, and he later worked for Warner Bros. Records.  He was responsible for preparing many of the "Warner Brothers Loss Leaders"  compilation albums of rock music issued by Warner Bros. in the 1970s, which featured new artists and new material from established Warner Brothers Records artists. (These were advertised on the inner sleeves of WBs current releases—and were only available by ordering direct from WB using a coupon printed on the record sleeve—and were priced at $1 per LP. Most of these releases were 2-LP sets, so they were priced at $2 at a time when a "double LP" would typically carry a $9.98 list price.) Using his real name of Barry Hansen, he also contributed many articles on rock music to magazines including Rolling Stone, Down Beat and Hit Parader, liner notes on various late-1960s and early 1970s albums, and in 1976 contributed the chapter on "Rhythm and Gospel" in The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock & Roll.<ref name=rs>Jim Miller (ed.), The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock & Roll, {{ISBN 0 330 26568 7}}, Picador, 1976, p.474</ref>

== Career ==

=== The Dr. Demento radio show ===
Hansen created the persona of Dr. Demento in 1970 while working at Pasadena, California Pasadena station KPPC (defunct) KPPC-FM.<ref name="offbio" />  The positive listener response to the offbeat novelties that Hansen included in his rock oldies show led to his eventually turning it into an all-novelty show.  At the end of 1971, he moved to KMET (FM) KMET in Los Angeles.  From 1972 to 1983, he performed a four-hour live show on KMET (FM) KMET. From about 1974 on, the local Los Angeles market was the full 4 hours and the nationally syndicated show was cut to 2 hours. Later, the show would be a two-hour live show on KAMP-FM#97.1KLSX (1986-1995) KLSX, and after they converted to a talk-only format in 1995, moved again to KSCA (FM) KSCA, where it remained until they changed to a Spanish-language broadcast, in February 1997.<ref>{{cite news  last1=Hochman  first1=Steve  title=Dementos Dilemma  date=10 April 1997  url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/155507192/  newspaper=The Los Angeles Times  department=Weekend  page=24  via=Newspapers.com}}</ref><!--Note:KSCA history beyond Dr. D not relevant to Dr. Demento-->

His weekly show went into national syndication in a two-hour all-novelty format in 1974, produced by his manager Larry Gordon of Gordon/Casady<ref name="offbio" /> and during 1978–92 was syndicated by the Westwood One (1976–2011) Westwood One Radio Network.  The Westwood One period marked the height of the shows national popularity; it was carried in most major radio markets, airing mainly on FM rock stations, usually late on Sunday evenings.  The producer Westwood One assigned to work with Hansen from 1978 to 1982 was Lynnsey Guererro, a former track star from UCLA and Senior Producer at the company.  In 1982, he handed off the show to a new producer from San Diego, professional journalist Robert Young. It was under Youngs guidance that the show gained in popularity, mainly due to his willingness to foster relationships with national media and with nationally known and up-and-coming artists, including John Mammoser, Judy Tenuta, Emo Philips, Pinkard and Bowden, Wally Wingert, and Mark Davis (Richard Cheese).   Young accompanied Dr. Demento to Portland, Ore.; Dallas, Texas; New York City; San Diego; Montreal; Phoenix; and other cities to do live performances and PR Events, taking photos, setting up interviews and even running the board at some of the live shows.  He left the radio network in 1990 during a business downturn. In January 2014 Young released an e-book titled "Producing Demento," about his memories of working on the show.<ref>{{cite web author=  url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/supernatural/the-e-book-producing-demento-the-dr-demento-show  title=The E-book "Producing Demento" ("The Dr. Demento Show"!) by Robert Young  publisher=Kickstarter.com  date=2014-02-01  accessdate=2014-03-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web url=http://dmdb.org/cgi-bin/plinfo.pl?drd92.0830.html  title=The Dr. Demento Show #92-35 - August 30, 1992  publisher=Dmdb.org  date=1992-08-30  accessdate=2014-03-30}}</ref>

From 1992 to 2000, the show was syndicated by On the Radio Broadcasting. Hansen, under the name "Talonian Productions," handled syndication himself from 2000 until discontinuing syndication in 2010 (though Hansen did not reveal he was Talonian until being forced to respond to significant criticism of the company in 2007{{citation needed date=March 2018}}; this despite the fairly obvious fact that Talonian had no involvement in any other show than Dr. Demento).  Between the mid-1970s and the mid-1990s, Hansen continued to do live broadcasts on KMET and other Los Angeles area stations, in addition to his weekly taped syndicated show.  He also made occasional television appearances, on such shows as The Gong Show (on the 1988-89 revival), Bobbys World and The Simpsons, and on the Barnes and Barnes music video for "Fish Heads (song) Fish Heads".

The syndicated radio show normally started with an hour of randomly chosen records and listener requests.  The second hour was normally mostly devoted to a specific theme (cars, sports, pets, romance, movies, etc.) with a final segment taken up by a "The Funny Five" countdown of the most requested songs.  There were also shows devoted to holidays and seasonal events, with the most important being the Halloween and Christmas shows (Hansen produced multiple Christmas shows during the holiday season consisting solely of novelty Christmas music), because of the large number of novelty records those holidays have inspired. The final radio episode each year was the Funny 25, a countdown of the 25 most requested novelty songs that year (see below).  For most of the syndicated shows history, Hansen produced 52 original weekly shows every year; repeat broadcasts were rare.

The programs opening theme is an instrumental version of "Pico and Sepulveda" recorded for the show by The Roto Rooter Good Time Christmas Band.  The same Los Angeles area group recorded some of the musical teasers used on the show, such as "Its time for number one...."  The other "countdown" intros come from "Barstow" by the American maverick composer Harry Partch.  Hansens opening line, "Wind up your radios," refers to the rare 78rpm novelty records from the days of wind-up phonographs that he has featured on the show, especially in its early years.  The closing theme is "Cheerio, Cherry Lips, Cheerio," a 1929 vocal by Scrappy Lambert (recording under the name Gordon Wallace), which Hansen tells listeners he discovered in a thrift shop.  The Doctor closes each show with "Stay Dement-ed!"

Whimsical Will (real name: William Simpson<ref>{{cite web url=http://dmdb.org/cgi-bin/plinfo_view.pl?DN0000001  title=details for Whimsical Will  publisher=Dmdb.org  date=  accessdate=2014-03-30}}</ref>) produced a weekly "Demented News" for the show since the late 1980s.  He also has recorded false comedy interviews "break-in" style, following Dickie Goodman, including "Hey Dickie" (1989), which is available on iTunes.

Starting in the late 1980s, the show began to lose affiliates, a victim of media consolidation and other changes in the radio industry that were pushing many alternative rock stations and individualistic broadcasters off the air. In 1992, Westwood One (1976–2011) Westwood One dropped the show which was immediately picked up by another syndicator, On the Radio Broadcasting.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.scpr.org/news/2010/06/11/dr-demento-wraps-40-years-air/  title=Dr. Demento wraps up 40 years on the air, moves online &#124; 89.3 KPCC  publisher=Scpr.org  date=2010-06-11  accessdate=2012-02-24  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628214252/http://www.scpr.org/news/2010/06/11/dr-demento-wraps-40-years-air/  archivedate=2011-06-28  df= }}</ref> This allowed the syndicated show to air records which were popular on the local Los Angeles show, but Westwood One would not allow, such as "Its A Gas" by Alfred E. Neuman and "Moose Turd Pie" by Utah Phillips. It also allowed Whimsical Wills Demented News, a fixture of the local Los Angeles show, to also air on the national show.

In 2000, Hansen formed Talonian Productions to syndicate the show himself.<ref>{{cite web url=http://dmdb.org/images/drddj.html  title=The Dr. Demento Show through the eyes of a disc jockey  publisher=Dmdb.org  date=  accessdate=2012-02-24}}</ref> According to Hansen, the show  steadily lost advertisers, and as such, he had to restructure the distribution of the show from the usual barter system to a system in which stations pay a rights fee for the program (though he apparently made exceptions in some major markets, such as WCKL-FM WLUP in Chicago). He stated in October 2007 that "unless the shows financial situation changes soon, I will be unable to continue the show much longer."<ref name="dr-note">{{cite web

In addition, according to the site, "...by special agreement and due to contractual considerations, a version of the internet show will be heard weekly on KACV-FM (in Amarillo, Texas), at least through the summer."<ref>{{cite web url=http://chicagoradioandmedia.com/news/640-dr-demento-ends-his-40-year-old-radio-show  title=Dr. Demento Ends His 40 Year Old Radio Show  publisher=Chicagoradioandmedia.com  date=2010-06-05  accessdate=2010-06-22}}</ref> The show was removed from KACV-FM in January 2011.

=== Online streaming ===
Beginning in approximately 2006, The Dr. Demento Show began offering pay-per-view pay-per-show audio streaming at the shows official website. Large archives from 1992 to the present, as well as a few select archives from the early 1970s, are available, but most of the syndicated programs from 1978 to 1992 are not because the broadcast rights are currently in limbo (Dial Global and later Cumulus Media purchased Westwood One in the early 2010s, but spun off several of its music shows to Compass Media Networks; its unknown whether the Dr. Demento syndicated archive was among the programs). Some live local shows which aired in Los Angeles from this period were added. As part of the contract between Dr. Demento and radio stations, radio stations were prohibited from streaming the program online. Several radio stations were forced to drop the program because of this policy, thus reducing Dr. Dementos affiliate count,<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.drdemento.com/radiostations.html  title=The Online Internet Site for Information on Dr. Demento music, songs, lyrics and chat  publisher=Drdemento.com  date=  accessdate=2014-03-30}}</ref> (at the end of the shows terrestrial run only six stations were carrying the show, versus over 100 at its peak), further exacerbating the shows financial problems and ability to sell advertising. Despite the shows terrestrial cancellation, new online episodes are expected to be produced for the foreseeable future. The show ended its terrestrial broadcast on a cliffhanger, with the last terrestrial broadcast devoted to songs involving the word "big" and the first post-terrestrial broadcast devoted to songs involving the word "little."

The online show follows a format similar to that of the terrestrial show; no longer being limited by a radio time slot or commercial breaks, the show usually exceeds two hours and may include "bonus tracks" at the end of the show.  The weekly "Funny Five" has been replaced by a monthly Top Ten in order to allow for more comprehensive special topic segments.  The new format, along with the ability to play records that previously would have been censored on the radio, has allowed Hansen to delve more deeply into his collection than was possible on the syndicated radio show.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127989850  title=Dr. Demento: Off The Air, But Still Happily Deranged  publisher=NPR.org  date=2010-06-22  accessdate=2014-04-02}}</ref>

=== Other media ===
From 2003 to 2005, XM Satellite Radio aired a weekly "Best of Dr. Demento" show (featuring a mixture of old and new material) initially on the Special X channel and then on the 60s on 6, Deep Tracks, and Laugh USA channels.

He was interviewed in the 2005 documentary film about outsider musician Wild Man Fischer, titled Derailroaded: Inside The Mind Of Wild Man Fischer. In September 2007, Dr. Demento portrayed the role of Hippocrates on The Radio Adventures of Dr. Floyd.

In addition to his syndicated show, he still makes occasional guest appearances for other shows. Among his more recent guest-hosting stints were for Montel Williams on the now-defunct Air America Media (despite the networks politically driven format, the guest stint followed his normal format of novelty music, specifically Halloween music, since the show aired on October 30, 2009, the day before Halloween)<ref>[http://airamerica.com/ondemand/10-30-2009/montel-10-30-2009-09-04-01/ ]{{dead link date=February 2012}}</ref> on Anything Anything with Rich Russo on Super Bowl Sunday in 2011 and 2013, and annually with classical music host Jim Svejda on New Years Eve. 

In April 2013, Meep Morp Studios began seeking donations to fund a documentary named Under the Smogberry Trees: The True Story of Dr. Demento through Kickstarter.<ref name="kickstarter1">{{cite web author=  url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/smogberrytrees/under-the-smogberry-trees-the-true-story-of-dr-dem  title="Under the Smogberry Trees: The True Story of Dr. Demento" by Meep Morp Studio  publisher=Kickstarter.com  date=  accessdate=2014-03-30}}</ref>  Under the Smogberry Trees was meant to be a filmed history of “The Dr. Demento Show”, covering the lasting impact of funny music on popular culture, and including current interviews with Dementites connected to and/or inspired by the show.  The Kickstarter campaign ended successfully on May 4, 2013 with a total of $118,722 in donations from 1,764 backers. On September 27, 2016, Hansen announced he had terminated his support for Meep Morps version of the film, was working on producing his own version of "Under the Smogberry Trees" with Devin Lucas as director, and forbade Meep Morp from continuing to use his name or likeness for their film.<ref>{{cite web  last1=Hansen  first1=Barret  title=A Message from Dr. Demento  date=27 September 2016  url=https://www.smogberrytreesmovie.com/  website=Under the Smogberry Trees: The True Story of Dr. Demento and Mr. Hansen  access-date=2017-04-05}}</ref> Meep Morps Under the Smogberry Trees, directed by Scott McKenzie, is listed as complete <ref>{{cite web url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3232458/ title=Under the Smogberry Trees publisher= via=www.imdb.com}}</ref> in IMDb as of 2016.

== Personal life ==
Hansen was married to Sue Hansen (née Sue Charles) from 1983 to her passing on September 10, 2017. Sue was a former clerk and training officer at the Union Pacific railroad for 12 years. Hansen describes himself as "an armchair railfan", sometimes sampling his extensive collection of railroad-related songs on his show.

Hansen has a long time interest in the roots of rock n roll in R&B and country music, and he has written about it in many magazine articles, liner notes to compilations and new recordings by a variety of artists, and two chapters on early R&B for The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock & Roll. His shows and public appearances display an encyclopaedic knowledge of the history of recorded music in general, from the earliest Edison cylinder recordings onward.

== Influence ==
Dr. Demento may be best known for bringing Parody parodist "Weird Al" Yankovic to national attention. In 1976, Hansen spoke at Yankovics school where Yankovic gave a self-recorded tape of comedy songs and parodies to Hansen. The first song, "Belvedere Cruisin" about the family station wagon, was featured on the show. Positive listener response encouraged Yankovic to record more parodies; Hansen would then fund Yankovics first EP, Another One Rides the Bus (EP) Another One Rides the Bus, which eventually led to a record deal and pop chart success in the 1980s and beyond. Hansen has appeared in a number of Weird Als music videos, as well as in Weird Als movie UHF (film) UHF.<ref name="Yankovic Bio">{{cite news last=Ankeny first=Jason  title=Weird Al Yankovic, Biography  url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/yankovic_weird_al/artist.jhtml#biographyEnd newspaper=MTV accessdate=2014-03-30}}</ref>

Other artists who attained widespread exposure after getting exposure on the Dr. Demento show include Barnes & Barnes ("Fish Heads (song) Fish Heads"), Ogden Edsl ("Dead Puppies","Kinko The Clown", "Daddys Money", "Idi Amin Meets Eydie Gorme"), Wild Man Fischer Larry "Wild Man" Fisher ("My Name Is Larry"), Larry Groce ("Junk Food Junkie", 1975) and Elmo Shropshire Elmo and Patsy ("Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer", 1979). The show helped revive and maintain interest in novelty hits from the 1950s and 1960s that received scant airplay on mainstream pop or oldies radio stations, including "Alley Oop" by the Hollywood Argyles, "The Ballad of Irving" by Frank Gallop, "The Battle of Kookamonga" by Homer and Jethro,  "Monster Mash" by Bobby "Boris" Pickett, "Hello Muddah, Hello Faddah Hello Muddah, Hello Faddah (A Letter from Camp)" by Allan Sherman, "I Want My Baby Back" by Jimmy Cross, and "Theyre Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa!" by Napoleon XIV. Hansen also revived interest in the double entendre songs of 1940s Borscht Belt comedian Benny Bell, especially Bells signature tune, "Shaving Cream (song) Shaving Cream". He introduced a new generation to the manic big-band parodies of Spike Jones, the musical black humor of Tom Lehrer, and the many novelty records recorded by satirist Stan Freberg in the 1950s.

The work of another frequently featured artist is Frank Zappa, whom Hansen cited as a major influence on the show and who appeared several times as a guest. The tribute show following Zappas 1993 death was the first time the entire two-hour show was devoted to a single artist.

Another of the shows highlights occurred in the late 1980s when the satire/parody/improv hard rock trio Spinal Tap (band) Spinal Tap came in for a visit. Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer appeared in full costume and stayed in character for a three-hour visit. Similar big moments occurred in a visit from Screamin Jay Hawkins ("I Put a Spell on You"), when the singer appeared in the studios in Culver City, California Culver City dressed in black cape, distributing explosive flash paper to great effect, and when Mel Brooks came in for an interview and was presented with an "absolutely HUGE" cheesecake from Canters Canters Deli on Fairfax Avenue.

Dr. Demento was parodied in an episode of Mr. Show with Bob and David as "Dr. Retarded: Novelty Record Collector and Chief Head of Surgery, Mass General" and is featured as an expert in songs about "paranormal monster parties".

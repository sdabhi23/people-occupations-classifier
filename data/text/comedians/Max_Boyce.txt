Maxwell Boyce, {{post-nominals country=GBR MBE}} (born 27 September 1943) is a Welsh people Welsh comedian, singer and entertainer. He rose to fame during the mid-1970s with an act that combined musical comedy with his passion for rugby union and his origins in the mining communities of South Wales. He has sold more than two million albums in a career spanning four decades.

==Early life==
Max Boyce was born in Glynneath. He has always lived there, but his family were originally from Ynyshir in the Rhondda Valley. A month preceding Boyces birth, his father died in an explosion in the coal pit where he was working.
At the age of fifteen, Boyce left school, went to live with his grandfather, and followed his fathers footsteps by working in a colliery "for nearly eight years".
In his early twenties, he managed to find alternative work in the Metal Box factory, Melin, Neath as an electricians apprentice, but his earlier mining experiences were to influence his music considerably in later years.{{cn date=July 2017}}

Boyce first learned to play the guitar as a young man, but he showed no particular flair for the instrument,
nor an actual desire to become a performer. In his own words: "[I had] no desire at all to be anything. I had a love of poetry, and eventually started writing songs without any ambition to build a career. It just happened. I started writing songs about local things and it evolved."
Nevertheless, in time he became competent enough to perform at local eisteddfodau, one of the earliest known recordings of his work being "{{lang cy O Na Le}}", a folk tune in Welsh language Welsh which he played at the Dyffryn Lliw eisteddfod in 1967.{{cn date=July 2017}}

In the early 1970s Boyce undertook a mining engineering degree at the Glamorgan School of Mines in Trefforest (now the University of South Wales),
during which he began to pen tunes about life in the mining communities of South Wales. He started out performing in local sports clubs and folk clubs around 1970, where his original set began to take on a humorous element, interspersed by anecdotes of Welsh community life and of the national sport, rugby union.
==Music career==
The first recording of Boyces songs was made at the Valley Folk Club in Pontardawe in 1971 by Cambrian Records, which subsequently released an LP album LP called Max Boyce in Session. This album included several tracks that were to later become his signature tunes, including "Hymns and Arias", "Duw its Hard" and "Slow - Men at Work". The record sleeve of this album includes the following prediction:
{{cquote It may well be that future years will find "Hymns and Arias" rolling a thunderous chorus across the terraced rugby grounds.
}}

In the same year, he also recorded {{lang cy Caneuon Amrywiol}} ("Miscellaneous Songs"), a collection of Welsh folk music folk songs under the same label. Nevertheless, Boyce remained virtually unknown beyond the music clubs of the South Wales valleys for the time being, where he continued to perform.This all changed towards the end of 1973. Boyce had competed, unsuccessfully, on the television talent show Opportunity Knocks (UK TV series) Opportunity Knocks, shortly before record label EMI heard his first album, Max Boyce in Session, and came to see him in concert. EMI offered Boyce a two-album contract, and arrangements were made to make a live recording of his upcoming concert at Treorchy Treorchy RFC Rugby Club. This performance, which took place on 23 November 1973, was given in front of an audience who received their tickets free of charge, after these failed to sell for Fifty pence (British coin) fifty pence.
His performance was warmly received by the crowd, as can be heard in the final recording. The resulting album, Live at Treorchy, brought Boyce into the public eye, and it soon went gold disc gold.{{cn date=July 2017}}

His next album, We All Had Doctors Papers, was another live album, recorded this time at Pontarddulais RFC Pontarddulais Rugby Club. This was released in late 1975 and, unexpectedly, it reached the #1 position on the UK Albums Chart for the week ending 15 November.
This recording has the distinction of being the only comedy album to ever top the UK Albums Chart.
Boyce released several albums over the next few years, receiving further gold discs for The Incredible Plan in 1976, and I Know Cos I Was There in 1978.
This early pinnacle in Boyces career coincided with the dominance of the Wales national rugby union team Welsh rugby team in the Five Nations Championship during the 1970s. His songs and poems were real-time reflections on this unfolding history, often invoking the names of Welsh rugby greats such as Barry John, Gareth Edwards and Dai Morris. Songs such as "Hymns and Arias" soon became popular with rugby crowds, a fact which has played a significant part in his ongoing popularity. When Swansea City were promoted to the English Premier League in 2011, Boyce was asked to perform for their first game and produced a special version of "Hymns and Arias" for the occasion.
His rise to fame was confirmed by an appearance on the long-running biographical series This Is Your Life (UK TV series) This Is Your Life on 22 February 1978.
He had gone to watch Glynneath RFC play against Hawick Trades RFC, and was surprised by the host of This Is Your Life, Eamonn Andrews, at the end of the match whilst being interviewed.
==Television and other side projects==
As Boyces popularity became established throughout Wales and the United Kingdom, he became involved in many side projects, including three books, several television series and televised concerts, and three multi-part television specials produced by Opix Films.{{cn date=July 2017}} His spoken and sung poetry was first collected in Max Boyce: His Songs and Poems in 1976, with an introduction by Barry John. The comic illustrations that accompany the poems were drawn by his friend Gren Jones (cartoonist) Gren Jones of the South Wales Echo (who had also illustrated the cover of We All Had Doctors Papers). This publication was followed up with a similar collection, I Was There!, in 1980.{{cn date=July 2017}}

In 1982, Boyce went to the United States to be filmed participating at a training camp held by the Dallas Cowboys in California. The resulting four-part series, Max Boyce Meets The Dallas Cowboys was screened by Channel 4 in November that year. He returned to America in early 1984 to try 
his hand at being a cowboy in the rodeos of the Midwestern United States. The result of his bull riding and rodeo clown antics was Boyce Goes West, which also became a four-part series that was broadcast in June 1984. 

In the following year, Boyce took part in the World elephant polo Elephant Polo Championships near Kathmandu, Nepal, with an all-star team sponsored by the jewellers and watchmakers Cartier SA Cartier. His team, consisting of Ringo Starr, Barbara Bach, Billy Connolly and Cartier chairman Alain Perrin (Cartier) Alain Perrin, only managed to score a single goal during the tournament.
To the North of Katmandu was released in 1986.
These made-for-television adventures in America and Nepal, as well as many other anecdotes of his worldwide touring throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s, became the focus of an autobiography, Max Boyce in the Mad Pursuit of Applause, which was first published in 1987.

In 1990, Boyce entered the world of theatre by taking on the title role of "Jack" in Jack and the Beanstalk alongside Ian Botham. Debuting in the Bradford Alhambra Alhambra Theatre in Bradford, the show went on to play in other centres including Cardiff, Norwich and Edinburgh.
==Recent years==
Max Boyce has enjoyed a resurgence in his career since the late 1990s. At Christmas time in 1998, BBC Wales screened An Evening With Max Boyce, which broke Welsh viewing records.
The  following year, in 1999, he performed at the opening ceremonies of the 1999 Rugby World Cup in the Millennium Stadium, and of the Welsh Assembly. Not long after, Boyce was included on the 2000 New Year Honours list, and received an MBE from Prince Charles in a ceremony at Cardiff Castle on 15 March that year. According to Boyce, "He (the Prince) said he was surprised it took them so long" to accord him this honour.
Boyces greatest musical success in recent years was his 2003 tour of Australia, coinciding with the 2003 Rugby World Cup Rugby World Cup which was being hosted there at the time. He held concerts in Adelaide and Melbourne, but the highlight was his sold-out performance at the Sydney Opera House, which was later released on DVD as Max Boyce: Down Under.{{cn date=July 2017}}

Boyce continues to make headlines in the British press. On 29 May 2006 Max Boyce headlined at a concert in Pontypridd to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Welsh national anthem, "Hen Wlad fy Nhadau".
In August 2006, he hit out against the stereotypical use of the word "boyo (slang) boyo" in the media, following its resurgence in reference to Welsh Big Brother 2006 (UK) Big Brother contestant Glyn Wise.
Boyce returned to Treorchy in early 2011 to perform a show at the Parc and Dare Hall Parc and Dare Theatre, shown on St Davids Day on BBC1 Wales. He was joined onstage by guests including Boyd Clack, and the audience featured such Welsh icons as Gareth Edwards.

His 70th birthday was celebrated with an hour-long programme
shown on BBC One Wales on 25 September 2013, recorded in front of a live celebrity audience.{{cn date=July 2017}}

{{Quotation Harry Secombe is one of the most famous of comedians from Wales. His reputation however rests with his singing and Neddy Seagoonery. Sir Geraint Evans possessed considerable talent for comedy and made us laugh in the roles of Falstaff and Leporello, but his career depended every move on his voice. Until Max Boyce, I can think of no-one who has become famous outside Wales for his Welshness. Jack Waterman The Listener, 1979

Christopher J Morris (born 15 June 1962) is an English comedian, writer, director, actor, voice actor, and producer. He is known for his black humour, surrealism, and controversial subject matter, and has been hailed for his "uncompromising, moralistic drive" by the British Film Institute.<ref name="screenonline">{{cite web title=Morris, Christopher (1963– ) url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/1392135/index.html publisher=British Film Institute accessdate=29 December 2012}}</ref>

In the early 1990s, Morris teamed up with his radio producer, Armando Iannucci, to create On the Hour, a satire of news programmes. This was expanded into a television spin off, The Day Today, which launched the career of Steve Coogan, and has since been hailed as one of the most important satirical shows of the 1990s.<ref>{{cite news author=Elizabeth Day  url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/apr/04/disgusting-bliss-chris-morris-biography  title=Disgusting Bliss by Lucian Randall &#124; Book review  work= The Observer  publisher=Guardian  date= 4 April 2010 accessdate=18 September 2013  location=London}}</ref> Morris further developed the satirical news format with Brass Eye, which lampooned celebrities whilst focusing on themes such as crime and drugs. For many, the apotheosis of Morris career was a Brass Eye special, which dealt with the moral panic surrounding paedophilia. It quickly became one of the most complained about programmes in British television history, leading the Daily Mail to describe him as "the most loathed man on TV".<ref>The Guardian (London) 21 February 2003 Review: CHRIS MORRIS: THE MOVIE: The last time he was in the news, it was for the paedophile special of his TV series Brass Eye. Now hes made a film – just 15 minutes long – which is tipped to win a Bafta on Sunday. In a rare interview, Britains greatest contemporary satirist talks to Xan Brooks about making the film, celebrities and why he wont be tackling the war on terror  BYLINE: Xan Brooks</ref>

Meanwhile, Morris postmodern sketch and ambient music radio show Blue Jam helped him to gain a cult following. He went on to win a BAFTA for Best Short Film after expanding a Blue Jam sketch into My Wrongs 8245–8249 & 117, which starred Paddy Considine. Blue Jam was adapted into the TV series Jam (TV series) Jam. This was followed by Nathan Barley, a sitcom written in collaboration with a then little-known Charlie Brooker that satirised hipster (contemporary subculture) hipsters, which had low ratings but found success upon its DVD release. Morris followed this by joining the cast of the Graham Linehan sitcom The IT Crowd, his first project in which he did not have writing or producing input.

In 2010, Morris directed his first feature-length film, Four Lions, which satirised Islamic terrorism through a group of inept British Pakistanis. Reception of the film was largely positive, earning Morris his second BAFTA, for "Outstanding Debut". Since 2012, he has directed four episodes of Iannuccis political comedy Veep (TV series) Veep and appeared onscreen in The Double (2013 film) The Double and Stewart Lees Comedy Vehicle.

===Radio career===
On graduating, Morris pursued a career as a musician in various bands, for which he played the bass guitar. He then went to work for Radio West, a local radio station in Bristol. He then took up a news traineeship with BBC Radio Cambridgeshire, where he took advantage of access to editing and recording equipment to create elaborate Parody spoofs and parody parodies.<ref>{{cite news author=Andy Beckett  url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/prank-master-chris-morriss-announcement-of-the-death-of-michael-heseltine-on-radio-1-was-just-one-among-many-notorious-japes-his-satire-is-big-with-the-media-but-how-popular-is-it-with-listeners-1377835.html  title=Prank master: Chris Morriss announcement of the death of Michael Heseltine on Radio 1 was just one among many notorious japes.

In July 1987, he moved on to BBC Radio Bristol to present his own show No Known Cure, broadcast on Saturday and Sunday mornings. The show was surreal and satirical, with odd interviews conducted with unsuspecting members of the public. He was fired from Bristol in 1990 after "talking over the news bulletins and making silly noises".<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-76826109.html title=Morris, the Man with a Mission to Cause Offence publisher=}}</ref> In 1988 he also joined, from its launch, BBC London 94.9 Greater London Radio (GLR). He presented The Chris Morris Show on GLR until 1993, when one show got suspended after a sketch was broadcast involving a child "outing" celebrities.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.pbjmgt.co.uk/artist/chris-morris  title=Chris Morris / Artists / PBJ – THE exclusive UK-based talent agency.

In 1991, Morris joined Armando Iannuccis spoof news project On the Hour. Broadcast on BBC Radio 4, it saw him work alongside Iannucci, Steve Coogan, Stewart Lee, Richard Herring and Rebecca Front. In 1992, Morris hosted Danny Bakers Radio 5 Morning Edition show for a week whilst Baker was on holiday. In 1994, Morris began a weekly evening show, the Chris Morris Music Show, on BBC Radio 1 alongside Peter Baynham and man with a mobile phone Paul Garner (comedian) Paul Garner. In the shows, Morris perfected the spoof interview style that would become a central component of his Brass Eye programme. In the same year, Morris teamed up with Peter Cook (as Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling), in a series of improvised conversations for BBC Radio 3 entitled Why Bother? (radio show) Why Bother?.

In 1994, a BBC Two BBC 2 television series based on On the Hour was broadcast under the name The Day Today. The Day Today made a star of Morris, and marked the television debut of Steve Coogans Alan Partridge character. The programme ended on a high after just one series, with Morris winning the 1994 British Comedy Award for Best Newcomer for his lead role as the Jeremy Paxman Paxmanesque news anchor.<ref name="bbc">{{cite news url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1460805.stm  title=UK &#124; Chris Morris: Brass Neck  publisher=BBC News  date=27 July 2001  accessdate=18 September 2013}}</ref>

In 1996, Morris appeared on the daytime programme The Time, The Place, posing as an academic, Thurston Lowe, in a discussion entitled "Are British Men Lousy Lovers?", but was found out when a producer alerted the shows host, John Stapleton.<ref name="bbc"/>

In 1997, the black comedy black humour which had featured in On the Hour and The Day Today became more prominent in Brass Eye, another spoof current affairs television documentary, shown on Channel 4. Brass Eye became known for tricking celebrities and politicians into throwing support behind public awareness campaigns for made-up issues that were often absurd or surreal (such as a drug called cake and an elephant with its trunk stuck up its anus).

From 1997 to 1999 Morris created Blue Jam for BBC Radio 1, a surreal taboo-breaking radio show set to an ambient soundtrack.<ref name="screenonline"/> In 2000 this was followed by Jam (TV series) Jam, a television reworking.<ref name="screenonline"/> Morris released a remix version of this, entitled Jaaaaam.<ref name="screenonline"/>

In 2001, a special episode of Brass Eye on the moral panic that surrounds pedophilia paedophilia attracted a record-breaking number of complaints – the total remains the third highest on UK television after Celebrity Big Brother 2007 (UK) Celebrity Big Brother 2007 and Jerry Springer: The Opera – as well as heated discussion in the press. Many complainants, some of whom later admitted to not having seen the programme (notably Beverley Hughes, a government minister),<ref>{{cite news  url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1335865/Minister-in-Brass-Eye-protest-has-not-even-seen-it.html  title=Minister in Brass Eye protest has not even seen it  first=Andy  last=McSmith  work=The Daily Telegraph  date=31 July 2001  accessdate=20 May 2009   location=London}}</ref> felt the satire was directed at the victims of paedophilia, which Morris denies. Channel 4 defended the show, insisting the target was the media and its hysterical treatment of paedophilia, and not victims of crime.

In 2002, Morris ventured into film, directing the short film short My Wrongs 8245–8249 & 117 My Wrongs#8245–8249 & 117, adapted from a Blue Jam monologue about a man led astray by a sinister talking dog. It was the first film project of Warp Films, a branch of Warp Records. In 2002 this won the British Academy of Film and Television Arts BAFTA for best short film.<ref name="bafta_2002"/> In 2005 Morris worked on a sitcom entitled Nathan Barley, based on the character created by Charlie Brooker for his website TVGoHome (Morris had contributed to TVGoHome on occasion, under the pseudonym Sid Peach<ref>{{cite web last1=Brooker first1=Charlie title=FULL SESSION - The Alternative MacTaggart: Charlie Brooker url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK8i2mRxX3s website=YouTube publisher=Guardian Edinburgh International Television Festival accessdate=14 January 2015}}</ref>). Co-written by Brooker and Morris, the series was broadcast on Channel 4 in early 2005.

===Post 2005: The IT Crowd, Comedy Vehicle, and Four Lions===
Morris was a cast member in The IT Crowd, a Channel 4 sitcom which focused on the information technology department of the fictional company Reynholm Industries. The series was written and directed by Graham Linehan (writer of Father Ted and Black Books, with whom Morris collaborated on The Day Today, Brass Eye and Jam) and produced by Ash Atalla (The Office (UK TV series) The Office). Morris played Denholm Reynholm, the eccentric managing director of the company. This marked the first time Morris has acted in a substantial role in a project which he has not developed himself. Morris character appeared to leave the series during episode two of the second series. His character made a brief return in the first episode of the third series.

In November 2007, Morris wrote an article for The Observer in response to Ronan Bennetts article published six days earlier in The Guardian. Bennetts article, "Shame on us", accused the novelist Martin Amis of racism. Morris response, "The absurd world of Martin Amis", was also highly critical of Amis; although he did not accede to Bennetts accusation of racism, Morris likened Amis to the Muslim cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri Abu Hamza (who was jailed for inciting racial hatred in 2006), suggesting that both men employ "mock erudition, vitriol and decontextualised quotes from the Quran" to incite hatred.<ref>{{cite news  last=Morris  first=Chris  url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/nov/25/bookscomment.religion  title=The absurd world of Martin Amis  publisher=The Observer  date=25 November 2007  accessdate=22 June 2008  quote=Last week Amis was called a racist. I saw him speak at the ICA last month. Was his negativity about Islam technically racist? I dont know. What I can tell you is that Martin Amis is the new Abu Hamza. [...] Like Hamza, Amis could only make his nonsense stand up with mock erudition, vitriol and decontextualised quotes from the Koran.   location=London}}</ref>

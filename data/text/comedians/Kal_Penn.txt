==Career==

===Acting career===
Penns feature film debut came in 1998 in Express: Aisle to Glory. He has since appeared in American Desi, Van Wilder, the final episode of The Lonely Island,  Malibus Most Wanted, A Lot Like Love, Dude, Wheres the Party?, Love Dont Cost a Thing (film) Love Dont Cost a Thing, Superman Returns, Epic Movie, The Namesake (film) The Namesake, the Harold & Kumar series, and an uncredited appearance in Deck the Halls (2006 film) Deck the Halls.

Penn says that he derived his acting name, Kal Penn, as a lark: "Almost as a joke to prove friends wrong, and half as an attempt to see if what I was told would work (that anglicized names appeal more to a white-dominated industry), I put Kal Penn on my resume and photos." His audition callbacks rose by 50 percent. He has stated that he prefers his birth name and uses "Kal Penn" only for professional purposes.

In January 2007, Penn appeared in the first four episodes of the sixth season of 24 (TV series) 24 as Ahmed Amar, a teenage terrorist. Penn says he nearly turned down the role due to personal ethics: 

<blockquote>I have a huge political problem with the role. It was essentially accepting a form of racial profiling. I think its repulsive. But it was the first time I had a chance to blow stuff up and take a family hostage. As an actor, why shouldnt I have that opportunity? Because Im brown and I should be scared about the connection between media images and peoples thought processes?<ref>Yuan, Jada (2007-03-04).

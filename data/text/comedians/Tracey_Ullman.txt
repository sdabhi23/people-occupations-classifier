Tracey Ullman (born 30 December 1959) is an English actress, comedian, singer, dancer, screenwriter, producer, director, author, and businesswoman. She holds both British and American citizenship.

Her earliest appearances were on British television sketch comedy shows A Kick Up the Eighties (with Rik Mayall and Miriam Margolyes) and Three of a Kind (TV series) Three of a Kind (with Lenny Henry and David Copperfield (comedian) David Copperfield). After a brief singing career, she appeared as Candice Valentine in Girls on Top (TV series) Girls on Top with Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders.

She emigrated from the United Kingdom to the United States where she starred in her own network television comedy series, The Tracey Ullman Show, from 1987 until 1990, which also featured the first appearances of the long-running animated media franchise, The Simpsons. She later produced programmes for HBO, including Tracey Takes On... (1996–99), for which she garnered numerous awards. Her sketch comedy series, Tracey Ullmans State of the Union, ran from 2008 to 2010 on Showtime (TV network) Showtime. She has also appeared in several feature films. Ullman was the first British woman to be offered her own television sketch show in both the United Kingdom and the United States.<ref>{{cite web title=Tracey Ullman returns to BBC with first television series in 30 years url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/jan/08/tracey-ullman-returns-to-bbc-with-first-television-series-in-30-years work=The Guardian publisher=Theguardian.com accessdate=8 January 2016}}</ref> In 2016, she returned to British television with the BBC sketch comedy show Tracey Ullmans Show, her first project for the broadcaster in over thirty years;<ref name=tusjan>{{cite web title=BBC - Tracey Ullmans Show - Media Centre url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2016/02/tracey-ullmans-show work=BBC publisher=BBC.co.uk accessdate=22 December 2015}}</ref> this led to the creation of the topical comedy series Tracey Breaks the News in 2017.

Her mother was British, with Romani people Roma ancestry,<ref>{{harvnb Ullman 1998 p=98}}</ref> and her father was a Roman Catholicism in Poland Roman Catholic Poles Pole.<ref>{{cite book title=The International Whos Who 2004 url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wwXjAAAAMAAJ year=2003 publisher=Psychology Press page=1712}}</ref> On the subject of the spelling of her name: "My real name is Trace Ullman, but I added the y. My mother said it was spelled the American way, but I dont think she can spell! I always wanted a middle name. My mum used to tell me it was Mary but I never believed her. I looked on my birth certificate and I didnt have one, just Trace Ullman."<ref>Look in TV Annual (Independent Television Books Ltd, 1984), p. 67.</ref>

Antony Ullman served in the Polish Army and was Dunkirk evacuation evacuated from Dunkirk in 1940. He subsequently worked as a solicitor, a furniture salesman, and a travel agent. He also brokered marriages and translated among the émigré Polish community. Dorin recognized their younger daughters talents early on and encouraged her to perform.<ref name=skitcom/>

In an interview with Fresh Air host Terry Gross, Ullman revealed that when she was six, her father, who had been recovering from a heart operation, died of a heart attack in front of her while the two were alone and as he was reading to her.<ref name=npr-state>{{cite web title=Tracy Ullman Takes on the State of the Union url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89037585 work=NPR publisher=NPR date=25 March 2008 accessdate=10 June 2015}}</ref> He was fifty years old.<ref name=vanityfair-88>{{cite journal  last=Kaplan  first=James  date=March 1991  title=Amazing Trace  url=  journal=Vanity Fair  publisher=Condé Nast Publications Inc. volume=54  issue=3  pages=pg.88}}</ref> "When that happens to you as a child, you can face anything.

The most disappointing thing happened when you were younger [...] Youre just braver and if good things happen youre really grateful."<ref name=npr-state/>

Ullman, who had been living an upper-middle class life, was uprooted to Hackbridge, southwest London, along with her older sister Patti and her mother, who could now barely make ends meet without their fathers income.<ref name=shemadeit>{{cite web  url=http://www.shemadeit.org/meet/biography.aspx?m=83  title=The Paley Center for Media &#124; She Made It &#124; Tracey Ullman  publisher=She Made It  date=30 December 1959  accessdate=17 March 2014  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317140929/http://www.shemadeit.org/meet/biography.aspx?m=83  archivedate=17 March 2014  df=dmy-all }}</ref> "After [Dad] died, our fortunes came and went because Mum couldn’t speak Polish and had to give up the business."<ref name=30years/>  Mother Dorin would go on to take a host of odd jobs. "My mother was always doing strange things like driving parts around for a garage, all covered in oil and paid 10 pounds a week. But she was very funny, and our defence against hardship was having a great sense of humour."<ref name=shemadeit/> On a separate occasion, on the subject of her mothers jobs, Ullman recalled: "[Mum] worked in a laboratory, testing food, and would bring home samples for our dinner. Sometimes shed have to report that formula X had been found unfit for human consumption."<ref>{{cite web url=http://pagesix.com/2008/05/09/mums-the-word-of-the-stars/  title=Mums the Word of the Stars  publisher=New York Post  date= 9 May 2008  accessdate=19 May 2014}}</ref> One of her mothers jobs enabled her to indulge in her penchant for observing people.

Ullman credits her sense of humour to a feeling of both classlessness as well as her mothers working class roots. "It comes from being classless, I think. My father was Polish and he died when I was six. And from being a little girl who went to gymkhana and had ponies, and went to a private school, and lived in a big house we suddenly didn’t have any money any more and had to go to a state school. And my mother’s family is all from South London, and we have a lot of uncles and friends over there. And when my father died they were very supportive, and they used to come down for the weekend - all these hordes of South London oiks. They used to invade our big Posh Bucks home and use the swimming pool, ride the ponies, and they were so funny these blokes; they really affected my sense of humour ... But I think the man who really affected my sense of humour was my uncle Butch, he was called Butch Castle. He was a decorator from South London - lazy old sod.  An he’s got the sharpest mind I’ve ever known; he’s so hysterically funny. And I wanted to be like him."<ref>{{cite news  author=Amanda Root title=Uncle Butch Castle & The Song & Dance Kid newspaper=New Musical Express date=24 December 1983 page=61}}</ref>

In the aftermath of their fathers death, their mother would slip into a deep depression and spend a lot of time in bed. In an effort to cheer her up, Ullman, along with her sister, created and performed a nightly variety show on the windowsill in their mothers bedroom. “It was originally the Patti Ullman Show. So I’m a spin-off of my sister’s show, as she likes to point out.” In the show, Ullman would mimic neighbours, teachers, family members, and celebrities such as Julie Andrews and Édith Piaf.<ref name=liveandexposed>{{cite video  people=Ullman, Tracey  date=2005  title=Tracey Ullman: Live and Exposed  medium=DVD  publisher=HBO Video}}</ref> "Some kids can play the piano or kick a football; I could just impersonate everyone."<ref>{{cite episode  title=S 6: Ep 224  series=The View (U.S. TV series) The View  network=American Broadcasting Company ABC  airdate=5 August 2003}}</ref> She would also perform alone for herself after everyone had gone to bed. "Id stand in front of the mirror and talk to myself until I fell asleep. Id interview myself as women with problems. Women in documentaries who had three kids and chain-smoked and husbands in prison that hit them."<ref name=liveandexposed/> Her mother would eventually remarry to a man who Ullman has described as a maniac who drove a London taxi and had a son who stole. "We werent the Brady Bunch, let me tell you!"<ref name=npr-state/> The marriage brought an end to the childrens late night antics. "There was a new person in her bed now and I couldnt do my nightly performance anymore. I was nine years old and my show had been cancelled." Alcoholism and domestic violence became a common occurrence in the household.<ref name=liveandexposed/> The marriage also resulted in the family moving around the country, with Ullman attending numerous state schools. Her flair for mimicry helped with the transitions as her new classmates didnt take to her upper crust accent. "I had to talk like them to avoid being beaten up."<ref name=queenofparody/>

Ullman wrote and performed in school plays<ref>{{cite journal  last=  first=  date=16 February 1984  title=The Tracey Ullman Show  url=http://41.media.tumblr.com/10173329d75001ab79fdb6810b83168b/tumblr_nky5r4PyEW1upi75eo1_1280.jpg  journal=Smash Hits  publisher=  volume=  issue=  pages=pg.38}}</ref> and it was there that she caught the eye of a headmaster who recommended that she attend a "special school." "I thought he meant a school for juvenile delinquents."<ref name=liveandexposed/> Eventually her mother agreed and at age twelve she won a full scholarship to the Italia Conti Academy. Despite the encouragement she received from family, friends, and teachers, her big boost of confidence came from a very unlikely source: a clairvoyant who predicted that she would become famous, especially in America.<ref>#Ullman Ullman, p. 141.</ref> Some of her earliest work included an appearance on The Tommy Steele Show when she was thirteen, and as a model for My Guy magazine.<ref name=classsystem/><ref>{{cite web title=Seventies teen mag My Guy gets one-off relaunch url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-412170/Seventies-teen-mag-My-Guy-gets-relaunch.html work=The Daily Mail publisher=Daily Mail Online date=23 October 2006 accessdate=10 June 2015}}</ref>

She would end up loathing Italia Conti saying, "I hated the pressure that many of the children were under. Many of the kids were forced to grow up too fast, their careers were being decided for them before they were 13. If I went to an audition then they’d always choose the sweetest, prettiest kid. I wasn’t obviously beautiful so I used to miss out." Ullman has also alleged that the owners taught their own children and that a certain level of favouritism seemed to exist. She also felt that the education she was receiving was of very little value. "These stupid teachers would come in and go, Good morning, darlings, lets all be dustbins! Id go, Oh, shut up! I wanna be a banana!"<ref>{{cite journal  last=  first=  date=September 1988  title=20 Questions Tracey Ullman  url=  journal=Playboy  publisher=Playboy Enterprises  volume=35  issue=9  pages=pg.166}}</ref>

With fame came intense scrutiny of her personal life. The press became increasingly aggressive, printing untrue or exaggerated stories, soliciting information from people who supposedly knew her.

Ullman, who had already made a name for herself as a comedian with her BBC comedy series Three of a Kind (TV series) Three of a Kind, had a chance encounter with the wife of the head of the Punk rock punk music label Stiff Records, Dave Robinson. The meeting led to her recording her first album. “One day, I was at my hairdresser, and Dave Robinson’s wife Rosemary leant over and said, ‘Do you want to make a record?’ I was having some of those Boy George kind of dreadlock things put in and I went, ‘Yeah I want to make a record.’ I would have tried anything.”<ref>{{cite book last=Balls first=Richard title=Be Stiff: The Stiff Records Story url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NOQkBQAAQBAJ year=2014 publisher=Soundcheck Books page=274}}</ref>

Her future husband Allan McKeown had reservations about her launching a music career and tried talking her out of it. “When I first met Miss Ullman, I was a TV producer, and I called her into my office in London and I told her that she had a big career in comedy, and she said to me, ‘Well actually, I’m doing a record next week,’ and I said, ‘Now listen here Miss Ullman, if I know anything about show business, is that you shouldn’t get involved with singing.

Ullmans songs were over-the-top evocations of 1960s and 1970s pop music with a 1980s edge, "somewhere between Minnie Mouse and the Supremes" as the Melody Maker put it, or "retro before retro was cool," as a reviewer wrote in 2002.

==Television career==

===Early years===
Ullman got her first television acting job when she was seventeen, in a Heinz soup commercial where she had to wear a cows head.<ref name=skitcom/>

She tried her hand at serious drama, playing Lynda Bellinghams daughter in the 1980 BBC TV series Mackenzie,<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0165043/combined IMDb: "Mackenzie" (1980)] Linked 13 January 2016</ref> but said that she found that she wasnt cut out to be a straight actress. "I really thought I was great when I did a quite serious soap opera for the BBC. I played a nice girl from St. Johns Wood. Mummy, I think Im pregnant. I dont know whos done it. Then I would fall down a hill or something. EEEEE! Oh, no, lost another baby. It seemed all I ever did was have miscarriages—or make yogurt."<ref>{{cite web title=Tracey Ullman Is Sitting Pretty as the Queen of Parody and Pops url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20089118,00.html work=Barbara Graustark publisher=(People Magazine) accessdate=9 January 2014 deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110090524/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20089118,00.html archivedate=10 January 2014 df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In 1981, the success of her performance in the Royal Court Theatres production of Four in a Million led to many offers; one being the chance to move into television comedy. The BBC was quick to cast her in the BBC Scotland sketch comedy programme A Kick Up the Eighties. The network was so impressed with her that it offered her her own series. She initially turned down the offer. "My first reaction was you must be joking, as women are treated so shoddily in comedy. Big busty barmaids and all those sort of cliches just bore me rigid."<ref>{{cite journal  last=  first=  date=  title=Traceys Papers  url=http://tracey-archives.tumblr.com/post/113163172393/tracey-ullman-the-face-no37  journal=The Face  publisher=  volume=  issue=  pages=pg.69}}</ref> She also had reservations due to a lack of female contemporaries. "At that time English women weret really allowed to be funny on television. I didnt have any examples. I mean, I didnt have a Gilda Radner, Carol Burnett, Lily Tomlin. I mean, my only point of reference, quite honestly, was the The Benny Hill Show Benny Hill girls."<ref name=liveandexposed/> Ullman got into her performing arts school by doing an impersonation of Lily Tomlin.<ref name=bookpage>{{cite web title=Enter the antic world of Tracey Ullman url=http://tracey-archives.tumblr.com/post/148769362063/enter-the-antic-world-of-tracey-ullman work=Bookpage.com publisher=Bookpage.com accessdate=10 August 2016}}</ref> Eventually a deal was made with the proviso that she would get to choose the shows writers, have script approval, and choose the costumes.<ref name=pressrelease/> Three of a Kind (TV series) Three of a Kind, co-starring comedians Lenny Henry and David Copperfield (comedian) David Copperfield, debuted in 1981.<ref>{{cite web title=BFI Screenonline: Three of a Kind (1981-83) url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/535119/ work=BFI Screenonline publisher=Screenonline.org.uk accessdate=12 December 2015}}</ref>

In an interview with Amanda Root for The Musical Express magazine, Ullman was asked about critics labeling the show non-sexist humour. Did it exist? "Not unless it’s cleverly done. When we did Three of a Kind we kept getting sketches sent in about me as a traffic warden, or me being a busty barmaid. Writers that have no idea about women - their typical way of starting a sketch is to say, Tracey is sitting there, filing her nails and chewing gum, as if all girls are stupid. Sketches beginning like that used to really get on my nerves. But as soon as we found the right team of writers, they weren’t into that sort of thing, so it worked out OK."<ref>{{cite web title=Tracey Ullman biography and filmography url=http://www.tribute.ca/people/tracey-ullman/5009/ work=Tribute.ca publisher=Tribute.ca accessdate=9 January 2014}}</ref> She went on to win her first BAFTA Award in the category of Best Light Entertainment Performance for Three of a Kind in 1984.<ref>{{cite web title=BAFTA Awards url=http://awards.bafta.org/award/1984/television/light-entertainment-performance work=BAFTA publisher=bafta.org accessdate=14 September 2015}}</ref>

The two eventually worked together on a television pilot for ITV Central Central Television, A Cut Above, about a 1960s hairdresser (McKeown’s former profession) who meets a posh girl (Ullman). “Pilot didnt work, but I got a husband out of it," said Ullman in 1990.<ref name=watchout>{{cite web title=Watch Out For Ullman Shes a Master of Accents, A Wiz at Changing Personalities.

In 1983, she signed on to star in a comedy about four women sharing a flat together, Girls on Top (TV series) Girls on Top (provisionally titled Four-Play, Bitches on Heat, and Four Fs to Share).

Her British agent put together a videotape containing a compilation of her work and began circulating it around Hollywood. The tape landed in the lap of Craig Kellem, vice president for comedy at Universal Television. "I could not believe my eyes. It was just about the most extraordinary piece of material Id seen in a long time." He wanted production on a series to begin immediately for her.<ref name=skitcom/>

A deal was struck right away with CBS television, who went from ordering a pilot to ordering a full series two weeks later. A script for I Love New York, a show about a "slightly wacky" British woman working in New York, was written by Saturday Night Live writer Anne Beatts. Ullman hated it and the deal deteriorated.<ref name=skitcom/>

Recalling the project, Ullman said, "Wed just hit on an idea, then some white-haired executive - very, very important - would come in from the race track and say, I dont like that idea. I think Tracey should be a caring person. I think there should be a kid in this. Now, Im just pitching here. I dont know if this is funny. But I think Tracey should love this kid and maybe theres a moment where she tells the kid something about life. And Id say, "Look - I dont want to work with little kids being cute who I eventually adopt."<ref name=goldfinger/>

She was also turned off by the industrys materialistic attitude. "Literally, you start your first meeting and already theyre thinking about three years syndication. Youre going to be worth $13 million. Youre going to be a very rich young lady. Id say, I dont want to talk about the millions of dollars now. Can we put that on hold?

{{Rquote right I don’t think there’s anybody like her, and that’s a big deal. If you insist, there are parallels to Peter Sellers, an actor who did brilliant sketch comedy. James L. Brooks on Tracey Ullman<ref name=realcharacter/>}}

Ullman’s agent then decided to send producer James L. Brooks some tapes of her work.<ref name=goldfinger/> Brooks, who had had a very successful career producing television sitcoms, had stepped away from the medium, opting instead for a career in film. Ullmans material was so good that it lured him back to television. "I started showing [her work] to people like youd show home movies," revealed Brooks.<ref name=realcharacter/> "I was just startled by the size of the talent. I got chills."<ref name=foxylady>{{cite journal  title=Foxy Lady  last=Zehme  first=Bill  date=27 August 1987  work=Rolling Stone  issn=0035-791X}}</ref>

Brooks felt that a sketch show would best suit her assets (acting, singing, and dancing). "Why would you do something with Tracey playing a single character on TV when her talent requires variety? You can’t categorize Tracey, so its silly to come up with a show that attempted to."<ref name=realcharacter/>

To ensure that she was well-versed in American comedy, Brooks sent her tapes of American sitcoms and variety shows to watch while at home, now pregnant. Ullman refers to it as "homework."<ref name=bravo>{{cite web title=Bravo - Influences: Tracey Ullman url=https://vimeo.com/52657083 website=Vimeo.com publisher=Vimeo accessdate=25 November 2015}}</ref>  She also visited the Paley Center for Media Museum of Television and Radio, which she would later be inducted into. She had in fact grown up watching American television in the 1970s in England. Two things stood out to her: the vast number of female comedians, as well as their not having to be conventionally attractive to be funny. "It was very true of my childhood that women needed to be sexy in order to be funny."<ref name=bravo/><ref>{{cite web title=Tracey Ullman Makes A Face url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/15/magazine/tracy-ullman-makes-a-face.html?pagewanted=1 work=The New York Times accessdate=28 July 2015}}</ref>

Scouting for a supporting cast to play opposite her began. Dan Castellaneta, a relative unknown, was asked to read for the show after he was spotted by Ullman at Chicagos The Second City Second City. Castellanetas portrayal of a blind man who wants to be a comedian brought her to tears instead of making her laugh.<ref>Lawsom, Tim; Persons, Alisa (2004).

Because the Fox network was new to the world of television production, a bureaucracy had not yet been established. This enabled the show to take risks and the freedom to try things that the major networks would never permit. The series landed an initial twenty-six episode commitment deal, unheard of for a television comedy. The Tracey Ullman Show debuted on 5 April 1987. Describing the show proved difficult. Creator Ken Estin dubbed it a "skitcom". A variety of diverse original characters were created for her to perform. Extensive makeup, wigs, teeth, and body padding were utilised, sometimes rendering her unrecognisable. One original character created by Ullman back in Britain was uprooted for the series: long-suffering British spinster Kay Clark (character) Kay Clark.<ref name=foxylady/>

A typical episode of The Tracey Ullman Show consisted of three sketches, one including a song and/or a heavily choreographed dance routine. Brooks was keen on showing off all of Ullmans abilities. "It’s Can you juggle this and keep throwing on more plates? I’m constantly amazed." Ullman opened and closed the show as herself, adding her trademark, "Go home!," which she would shout to the studio audience for the closing. The show was shot on film, a departure from previous variety shows which were routinely shot on tape.<ref name=foxylady/>

In 1991, she had given birth to her second child, Johnny, and her husband was bidding on a television franchise in the South of England. Along with the bid he included a potential television programming lineup. Listed was a Tracey Ullman special. Ullman thought nothing would come of it, but to her horror, she learnt that the bid was successful.<ref name=takeson1>{{harvnb Ullman 1998 p=xi}}</ref>

The frantic pace of The Tracey Ullman Show was one of the key factors in her decision to give up television. That show was shot in front of a live studio audience and featured her playing on average three characters a week. She frequently wore layers of costuming to disguise herself. The prosthetic makeup was at times excessive. In her book Tracey Takes On (book) Tracey Takes On, she recalls an incident where she fainted on the makeup room floor, having to be revived before rushing out to give a performance.<ref name=takeson1/>

Unlike the Fox show though, this special would be shot entirely on location, allowing ample time to apply makeup, wigs, and other accoutrements for the characters; so Ullman felt less panicked. She decided to do a send up of the Social structure of the United Kingdom British class system. All new characters were created and she was joined by Monty Pythons Michael Palin for each of the shows sketches. Tracey Ullman: A Class Act premiered on 9 January 1993 on ITV (TV network) ITV.<ref>{{cite web title=BBC - Comedy - Guide - Tracey Ullman: A Class Act  url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/t/traceyullmanacla_66603500.shtml  work=BBC  publisher=BBC.co.uk  accessdate=14 September 2015  deadurl=unfit  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050404051645/http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/t/traceyullmanacla_66603500.shtml  archivedate=4 April 2005 }}</ref>

The American cable network Home Box Office HBO became interested in Ullman doing a special for their network with the caveat that she take on a more American subject. She chose New York.<ref>{{harvnb Ullman 1998 p=xiii}}</ref>

The special, Tracey Ullman Takes On New York debuted on 9 October 1993 and both it and Ullman went on to win two Emmy Awards, a CableACE Awards CableAce Award, an American Comedy Awards American Comedy Award, and a Writers Guild of America Award. The success of the special led the network to broach the subject of a "Takes On" series. Ullman and her husband liked the idea and set up production on Tracey Takes On... in Los Angeles in 1995.<ref>{{harvnb Ullman 1998 p=xv}}</ref>

As with the special Takes On New York, each episode of Tracey Takes On... centered on a single subject. Characters created for A Class Act and Takes On New York were adapted for the HBO series, along with several new characters, as well as the character Kay Clark. Unlike The Tracey Ullman Show, Tracey Takes On... had a rotating roster of upwards of twenty characters repeated throughout the run of the show.<ref>{{harvnb Ullman 1998 p=xix-xxvi}}</ref> Also, unlike The Tracey Ullman Show, Tracey Takes On... was a Single-camera setup single-camera comedy, shot heavily on location, without a studio audience.

{{cquote Its been fascinating to watch Ullman evolve from, say, Imogene Coca and Carol Burnett to something leaner and meaner, like a young Whoopi Goldberg. Or Lenny Bruce, with his surreal jive and need to shock. Or Lily Tomlin, signalling in coded transmissions through a worm hole to some parallel universe. Or Anna Deavere Smith, chameleon and exorcist, seeing around corners and speaking in tongues. Or, of course, Robin Williams, before all the bad films and worse career choices, a brilliant mind unmade of equal parts politics and paranoia, music video and psychotherapy, a scrambled shaman egghead and Jack–in–a–Pandoras box. Think of America as performance art.<ref>[http://nymag.com/arts/tv/reviews/45294/ America (The Cable Show)]. New York Magazine. John Leonard. 24 March 2008.</ref>}}

Ullman commented that the United States is "now able to laugh at itself more," embracing more satire satiric humour rather than deeming it "unpatriotic."

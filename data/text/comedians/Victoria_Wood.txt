Victoria Wood, {{postnominals country=GBR size=100% CBE}} (19 May 1953 – 20 April 2016) was an English comedian, actress, singer and songwriter, screenwriter, producer and director. Wood wrote and starred in dozens of sketches, plays, musicals, films and sitcoms over several decades, and her live comedy act was interspersed with her own compositions, which she performed on the piano. Much of her humour was grounded in everyday life and included references to quintessentially "British" activities, attitudes and products. She was noted for her skills in observing culture and in satirising social classes.
Wood started her career in 1974 by appearing on the Associated Television ATV talent show New Faces. She established herself as a comedy star in the 1980s, winning a British Academy Television Award for Best Entertainment Performance BAFTA TV Award in 1986 for the sketch series Victoria Wood as Seen on TV (1985–87), and became one of Britains most popular stand-up comics,
winning a second BAFTA for An Audience with... An Audience with Victoria Wood (1988). In the 1990s she wrote and co-starred in the television film Pat and Margaret (1994) and the sitcom Dinnerladies (TV series) Dinnerladies (1998–2000).
She won two more BAFTA TV Awards, including British Academy Television Award for Best Actress Best Actress, for her 2006 ITV1 television film, Housewife, 49.
Her frequent long-term collaborators included Julie Walters, Celia Imrie, Duncan Preston, and  Anne Reid.
In 2006, Wood came tenth in ITV (TV Network) ITVs poll of the British publics TVs 50 Greatest Stars 50 Greatest TV Stars.

==Early years==

Victoria Wood was the youngest child of Stanley Wood, an insurance salesman, who also wrote songs for his companys Christmas parties,
and Nellie Wood (née Mape).
She had three siblings: a brother, Chris Foote Wood Chris, and two sisters, Penny and Rosalind.
Wood was born in Prestwich and brought up in Bury, Greater Manchester Bury - both then in Lancashire. She was educated at Fairfield County Primary school
and Bury Grammar School (Girls) Bury Grammar School for Girls,
where she immediately found herself out of her depth. She recalled in an interview for Desert Island Discs in 2007:

{{quote  I was always top of the class, and when I went to grammar school I could not deal with everyone being as clever... I went under. I was a mess, a bit of a misfit. I didnt have any friends, let alone try to be funny...I didnt do any work, didnt have clean clothes and didnt wash. If I didnt have any money Id steal from people, and if I hadnt done my homework Id steal someone elses. I was envious of all the groups: the horsey group, the girls who went out with boys, the clever ones. Looking back, I feel really sorry for that little girl.
}}

Wood developed eating disorders, but in 1968, her father gave her a piano for her 15th birthday.
She later said of this unhappy time "The good thing about being isolated is you get a good look at what goes on. I was reading, writing and working at the piano all the time. I was doing a lot of other things that helped me to perform".
Later that year she joined the Rochdale Youth Theatre Workshop, where she felt she was "in the right place and knew what I was doing" and she made an impression with her comic skill and skill in writing.
She went on to study drama at the University of Birmingham.
==Career==

===1970s===
Wood began her show business career while an undergraduate, appearing on the TV talent show New Faces in 1974.
It led to an appearance in a sketch show featuring the series winners The Summer Show.
A further break came as a novelty act on the BBCs consumer affairs programme Thats Life! in 1976. She met long-term collaborator Julie Walters in the early 1970s when Wood applied for Manchester Polytechnic,
and coincidentally met again when they appeared in the same theatre revue In at the Death in 1978 (for which Wood wrote a brief sketch). Its success led to the commissioning of Woods first play Talent (1978 play) Talent (in 1978), starring Hazel Clyne (in a role originally written for Walters), for which Wood won an award for the Most Promising New Writer. Peter Eckersley (TV producer) Peter Eckersley, the head of drama at ITV Granada Granada Television, saw Talent and invited Wood to create a television adaptation. This time Julie Walters took the lead role, while Wood reprised her stage role.
===1980–88===
The success of the television version of Talent led to Wood writing the follow-up, Nearly a Happy Ending. Shortly afterwards she wrote a third play for Granada, Happy Since I Met You, again with Walters alongside Duncan Preston as the male lead. In 1980, she wrote and starred in the stage play Good Fun.
Recognising her talent, Eckersley offered Wood a sketch show, although she was unsure of the project; she only agreed to go ahead if Walters received equal billing. Eckersley came up with an obvious title - Wood and Walters,
and the pilot episode was recorded. It led to a full series, featuring Duncan Preston and a supporting cast. In the period between the completion of the pilot and the shooting of the series, Eckersley died. Wood credited him with giving her her first big break, and felt that Wood and Walters suffered due to his death.
She was not impressed by Brian Armstrong, his fill-in, and was of the opinion that he hired unsuitable supporting actors.
Wood appeared as a presenter in Yorkshire Televisions 1984 schools television programme for hearing-impaired children, Insight, in a remake of the series originally presented by Derek Griffiths. In 1982 and 1983 she appeared as a panellist on BBC Radio 4s Just a Minute.

In October 1983 Wood performed her first solo stand up show, Lucky Bag in a five-week run at the Kings Head Theatre in Islington. The show transferred to the Ambassadors Theatre for a twelve night run in February 1984. Lucky Bag went on a short UK tour in November and December 1984 and was also released as a live album recorded at the Edinburgh Festival in 1983.
Wood left Granada in 1984 for the BBC, who promised her more creative control over projects. Later that year, her sketch show Victoria Wood as Seen on TV went into production. Wood chose the actors: her friend Julie Walters once again starred, as did Duncan Preston. Woods friend Celia Imrie and Susie Blake and Patricia Routledge were in the cast. As Seen on TV had the Acorn Antiques sketch, a parody of a low-budget soap opera, Crossroads (soap opera) Crossroads, and rumoured to be named after an antiques shop in her birthplace. Acorn Antiques is remembered for characters such as "Mrs Overall" (played by Walters), the deliberately bad camera angles and wobbling sets, and Celia Imries sarcastic tone as "Miss Babs". Woods most popular comic song,
"The Ballad of Barry and Freda (Lets Do It)", originated in this show. It tells the story of Freda (a woman eager for sex) and Barry (an introverted man terrified of sex), and makes clever use of allusions to a multitude of risqué activities while avoiding all taboo words.
A second series of Victoria Wood as Seen on TV was made in 1986, followed by a one-off special in 1987.

In October 1987 Wood went on the road with her one-woman show. The tour included a sell out run at the London Palladium and had a second leg in April 1988. The end of 1988 saw the release of her second live performance Victoria Wood Live recorded at the Brighton Dome.
In 1988 she appeared in the BAFTA-winning An Audience with... An Audience with Victoria Wood for ITV (TV network) ITV. At the time of recording the show she was six months pregnant.

===1989–99===
During this period Wood moved away from the sketch show format and into more self-contained works, often with a bittersweet flavour. Victoria Wood (1989 TV series) Victoria Wood (six parts, 1989) featured Wood in several individual stories such as "Wed Quite Like To Apologise", set in an airport departure lounge, and "Over to Pam", set around a fictional talk show.
In May 1990 Wood went on a 60-date tour of the United Kingdom which was followed by a ten-week run at the Strand Theatre in London titled Victoria Wood Up West. Wood took the show on the road again during March 1991 where it was recorded at the Mayflower Theatre in Southampton, and later released as Victoria Wood Sold Out in 1991.
She briefly returned to sketches for the 1992 Christmas Day special Victoria Woods All Day Breakfast.

In March 1993 Wood began a seven-month tour of the UK. The 104-date tour broke box office records, including 15 sell out shows at Londons Royal Albert Hall, and played to residencies in Sheffield, Birmingham, Plymouth, Bristol, Nottingham, Manchester, Leicester, Liverpool, Bournemouth, Oxford, Southampton, Newcastle, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Leeds and Hull.
The television film Pat and Margaret (1994), starring Wood and Julie Walters as long-lost sisters with very different lifestyles, continued her return to stand-alone plays with a poignant undercurrent to the comedy.
In 1994 Wood starred in the one-off BBC 80-minute programme based on her 1993/94 stage show Victoria Wood: Live in Your Own Home. The special featured stand-up routines, character monologues and songs.
A shortened (48 minutes) version was released on DVD.

Wood set out on a 68-date tour of the UK in May 1996 which played at venues in Leicester, Sheffield, Ipswich, Blackpool, Bradford, Newcastle, Bournemouth, Brighton, Nottingham, Oxford, Southend, Manchester and Cambridge. The tour culminated with another 15 sell out shows at Londons Royal Albert Hall in the autumn. The tour recommenced in April 1997 in Liverpool and then travelled to Australia and New Zealand during the Summer. It was later released as Victoria Wood Live 1997.
In October 1997 Wood released a compilation of 14 of her songs titled Victoria Wood, Real Life The Songs.
Her first sitcom Dinnerladies (TV series) Dinnerladies (1998), continued her now established milieu of mostly female, mostly middle-aged characters depicted vividly and amusingly, but with a counterpoint of sadder themes.
===2000–05===
December 2000 saw the Christmas sketch show special Victoria Wood with All the Trimmings, featuring her regular troupe of actors as well as a string of special guest stars including Hugh Laurie, Angela Rippon, Bob Monkhouse, Bill Paterson (actor) Bill Paterson, Delia Smith and Roger Moore.

2001 saw Wood embark on her last ever stand up tour. The tour was titled Victoria Wood At It Again but was postponed slightly by Wood having to have an emergency hysterectomy shortly before the tour was due to begin. She re-wrote the entire first half of the show and incorporated the operation into her act. The 62-date tour included twelve nights at the Royal Albert Hall and had a further 23 dates in 2002.
During this period Wood tended to move away from comedy to focus on drama. She continued to produce one-off specials including Victoria Woods Sketch Show Story (2002) and Victoria Woods Big Fat Documentary (2005).
Wood wrote her first musical, Acorn Antiques: The Musical!, which opened in 2005 at the Haymarket Theatre Theatre Royal, Haymarket, London, for a limited period, directed by Trevor Nunn.

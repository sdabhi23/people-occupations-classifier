Sir Charles Spencer Chaplin {{post-nominals country=GBR KBE}} (16 April 1889 – 25 December 1977) was an English  comic actor, filmmaker, and composer<!--see talk page before adding or removing occupations--> who rose to fame in the era of silent film. Chaplin became a worldwide icon through his screen persona "the Tramp" and is considered one of the most important figures in the history of the film industry.{{sfnm 1a1=Cousins  1p=72 2a1=Kemp 2pp=8, 22 3a1=Gunning 3p=41 4a1=Sarris 4p=139 5a1=Hansmeyer 5p=3}} His career spanned more than 75 years, from childhood in the Victorian era until a year before his death in 1977, and encompassed both adulation and controversy.

Chaplins childhood in London was one of poverty and hardship. As his father was absent and his mother struggled financially, he was sent to a workhouse twice before the age of nine. When he was 14, his mother was committed to a mental asylum. Chaplin began performing at an early age, touring music halls and later working as a stage actor and comedian. At 19, he was signed to the prestigious Fred Karno company, which took him to America. Chaplin was scouted for the film industry and began appearing in 1914 for Keystone Studios. He soon developed the Tramp persona and formed a large fan base. Chaplin directed his own films from an early stage and continued to hone his craft as he moved to the Essanay Studios Essanay, Mutual Film Mutual, and First National Pictures First National corporations. By 1918, he was one of the best-known figures in the world.

In 1919, Chaplin co-founded the distribution company United Artists, which gave him complete control over his films. His first Feature length feature-length was The Kid (1921 film) The Kid (1921), followed by A Woman of Paris (1923), The Gold Rush (1925), and The Circus (film) The Circus (1928). He refused to move to sound films in the 1930s, instead producing City Lights (1931) and Modern Times (film) Modern Times (1936) without dialogue. Chaplin became increasingly political, and his next film, The Great Dictator (1940), satirised Adolf Hitler. The 1940s were a decade marked with controversy for Chaplin, and his popularity declined rapidly. He was accused of Communism communist sympathies, while his involvement in a paternity suit and marriages to much younger women caused scandal. An Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI investigation was opened, and Chaplin was forced to leave the United States and settle in Switzerland. He abandoned the Tramp in his later films, which include Monsieur Verdoux (1947), Limelight (1952 film) Limelight (1952), A King in New York (1957), and A Countess from Hong Kong (1967).

Chaplin wrote, directed, produced, edited, starred in, and composed the music for most of his films. He was a perfectionist, and his financial independence enabled him to spend years on the development and production of a picture. His films are characterised by slapstick combined with pathos, typified in the Tramps struggles against adversity. Many contain social and political themes, as well as autobiographical elements. In 1972, as part of a renewed appreciation for his work, Chaplin received an Academy Honorary Award Honorary Academy Award for "the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century". He continues to be held in high regard, with The Gold Rush, City Lights, Modern Times, and The Great Dictator often ranked on industry lists of the greatest films of all time.

====Background and childhood hardship====
Charles Spencer Chaplin was born on 16 April 1889 to Hannah Chaplin (born Hannah Harriet Pedlingham Hill) and Charles Chaplin Sr. There is no official record of his birth, although Chaplin believed he was born at East Street, Walworth, in South London.{{sfn Robinson p=10}}{{refn An MI5 investigation in 1952 was unable to find any record of Chaplins birth.<ref>{{cite news last=Whitehead  first=Tom  date=17 February 2012  title=MI5 Files: Was Chaplin Really a Frenchman and Called Thornstein?  url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/9086510/MI5-files-Was-Chaplin-really-a-Frenchman-and-called-Thornstein.html  newspaper=The Telegraph  accessdate=11 April 2012  deadurl=no  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424011812/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/9086510/MI5-files-Was-Chaplin-really-a-Frenchman-and-called-Thornstein.html  archivedate=24 April 2012  df= }}</ref> Chaplin biographer David Robinson notes that it is not surprising that his parents failed to register the birth: "It was easy enough, particularly for music hall artists, constantly moving (if they were lucky) from one town to another, to put off and eventually forget this kind of formality; at that time the penalties were not strict or efficiently enforced."{{sfn Robinson p=10}} In 2011 a letter sent to Chaplin in the 1970s came to light which claimed that he had been born in a Gypsy caravan at Black Patch Park in Smethwick, Staffordshire. Chaplins son Michael Chaplin (actor) Michael has suggested that the information must have been significant to his father in order for him to retain the letter.<ref>{{cite news date=18 February 2011  title=Charlie Chaplin Was Born into a Midland Gipsy Family  url=https://www.expressandstar.com/news/2011/02/18/charlie-chaplin-was-born-into-midland-gipsy-family/  newspaper=Express and Star  accessdate=17 February 2012  deadurl=no  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222045249/http://www.expressandstar.com/news/2011/02/18/charlie-chaplin-was-born-into-midland-gipsy-family/  archivedate=22 February 2012  df= }}</ref> Regarding the date of his birth, Chaplin believed it to be 16 April, but an announcement in the 11 May 1889 edition of The Magnet stated it as the 15th.{{sfn Robinson p=xxiv}} group=note}} His mother and father had married four years previously, at which time Charles Sr. became the legal carer of Hannahs illegitimate son, Sydney Chaplin Sydney John Hill.{{sfn Robinson pp=3–4, 19}}{{refn Sydney was born when Hannah Chaplin was 19. The identity of his biological father is not known for sure, but Hannah claimed it was a Mr. Hawkes.{{sfn Robinson p=3}} group=note}} At the time of his birth, Chaplins parents were both music hall entertainers. Hannah, the daughter of a shoemaker,{{sfn Robinson p=3}} had a brief and unsuccessful career under the stage name Lily Harley,{{sfn Robinson pp=5–7}} while Charles Sr., a butchers son,{{sfn Weissman (2009) p=10}} was a popular singer.{{sfn Robinson pp=9–10, 12}} Although they never divorced, Chaplins parents were estranged by around 1891.{{sfn Robinson p=13}} The following year, Hannah gave birth to a third son – Wheeler Dryden George Wheeler Dryden – fathered by the music hall entertainer Leo Dryden. The child was taken by Dryden at six months old, and did not re-enter Chaplins life for 30 years.{{sfn Robinson p=15}}

Chaplins childhood was fraught with poverty and hardship, making his eventual trajectory "the most dramatic of all the rags to riches stories ever told" according to his authorised biographer David Robinson (film critic) David Robinson.{{sfn Robinson p=xv}} Chaplins early years were spent with his mother and brother Sydney in the London district of Kennington; Hannah had no means of income, other than occasional nursing and dressmaking, and Chaplin Sr. provided no financial support.{{sfn Robinson p=16}} As the situation deteriorated, Chaplin was sent to Lambeth Workhouse when he was seven years old.{{refn Hannah became ill in May 1896, and was admitted to hospital. Southwark Council ruled that it was necessary to send the children to a workhouse "owing to the absence of their father and the destitution and illness of their mother".{{sfn Robinson p=19}} group=note}} The council housed him at the Central London District School for Pauperism paupers, which Chaplin remembered as "a forlorn existence".{{sfn Chaplin p=29}} He was briefly reunited with his mother 18 months later, before Hannah was forced to readmit her family to the workhouse in July 1898. The boys were promptly sent to West Norwood Norwood Schools, another institution for destitute children.{{sfn Robinson pp=24–26}}

In September 1898, Hannah was committed to the London County Council Asylum with provision for Croydon, commonly known as Cane Hill Asylum, which was in 1930 renamed Cane Hill Hospital Cane Hill Mental Hospital <ref>https://ezitis.myzen.co.uk/canehill.html</ref>.  She had developed a psychosis seemingly brought on by an infection of syphilis and malnutrition.{{sfn Weissman (2009) pp=49–50}} For the two months she was there, Chaplin and his brother Sydney were sent to live with their father, whom the young boys scarcely knew.{{sfn Chaplin pp=15, 33}} Charles Sr. was by then a severe alcoholic, and life there was bad enough to provoke a visit from the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.{{sfn Robinson p=27}} Chaplins father died two years later, at 38 years old, from cirrhosis of the liver.{{sfn Robinson p=36}}

Hannah entered a period of remission but, in May 1903, became ill again.{{sfn Robinson p=27}} Chaplin, then 14, had the task of taking his mother to the infirmary, from where she was sent back to Cane Hill.{{sfn Robinson p=40}} He lived alone for several days, searching for food and occasionally sleeping rough, until Sydney – who had enrolled in the Navy two years earlier – returned.{{sfnm 1a1=Weissman 1y=(2009) 1p=6 2a1=Chaplin 2pp=71–74 3a1=Robinson 3p=35}} Hannah was released from the asylum eight months later,{{sfn Robinson p=41}} but in March 1905, her illness returned, this time permanently. "There was nothing we could do but accept poor mothers fate", Chaplin later wrote, and she remained in care until her death in 1928.{{sfnm 1a1=Chaplin 1p=88 2a1=Robinson 2pp=55–56}}

====Young performer====
File:Chaplin in Sherlock Holmes.jpg thumb upright left A teenage Chaplin in the play Sherlock Holmes (play) Sherlock Holmes, in which he appeared between 1903 and 1906

Between his time in the poor schools and his mother succumbing to mental illness, Chaplin began to perform on stage. He later recalled making his first amateur appearance at the age of five years, when he took over from Hannah one night in Aldershot.{{refn According to Chaplin, Hannah had been booed off stage, and the manager chose him – as he was standing in the wings – to go on as her replacement. He remembered confidently entertaining the crowd, and receiving laughter and applause.{{sfnm 1a1=Robinson 1p=17 2a1=Chaplin 2p=18}} group=note}} This was an isolated occurrence, but by the time he was nine Chaplin had, with his mothers encouragement, grown interested in performing. He later wrote: "[she] imbued me with the feeling that I had some sort of talent".{{sfn Chaplin p=41}} Through his fathers connections,{{sfn Marriot p=4}} Chaplin became a member of the The Eight Lancashire Lads Eight Lancashire Lads Clog dance clog-dancing troupe, with whom he toured English music halls throughout 1899 and 1900.{{refn The Eight Lancashire Lads were still touring until 1908; the exact time Chaplin left the group is unverified, but based on research, A. J. Marriot believes it was in December 1900.{{sfn Marriot p=213}} group=note}} Chaplin worked hard, and the act was popular with audiences, but he was not satisfied with dancing and wished to form a comedy act.{{sfn Chaplin p=44}}

In the years Chaplin was touring with the Eight Lancashire Lads, his mother ensured that he still attended school but, by age 13, he had abandoned education.{{sfn Louvish p=19}}<!-- mother -->{{sfn Robinson p=39}}<!-- abandoned --> He supported himself with a range of jobs, while nursing his ambition to become an actor.{{sfn Chaplin p=76}} At 14, shortly after his mothers relapse, he registered with a theatrical agency in Londons West End of London West End. The manager sensed potential in Chaplin, who was promptly given his first role as a newsboy in Harry Arthur Saintsburys Jim, a Romance of Cockayne.{{sfn Robinson pp=44–46}} It opened in July 1903, but the show was unsuccessful and closed after two weeks. Chaplins comic performance, however, was singled out for praise in many of the reviews.{{sfnm 1a1=Marriot 1pp=42–44 2a1=Robinson 2pp=46–47 3a1=Louvish 3p=26}}

Saintsbury secured a role for Chaplin in Charles Frohmans production of Sherlock Holmes (play) Sherlock Holmes, where he played Billy the pageboy in three nationwide tours.{{sfn Robinson pp=45, 49–51, 53, 58}} His performance was so well received that he was called to London to play the role alongside William Gillette, the original Holmes.{{refn William Gillette co-wrote the Sherlock Holmes play with Arthur Conan Doyle, and had been starring in it since its New York opening in 1899. He had come to London in 1905 to appear in a new play, Clarice. Its reception was poor, and Gillette decided to add an "after-piece" called The Painful Predicament of Sherlock Holmes. This short play was what Chaplin originally came to London to appear in. After three nights, Gillette chose to close Clarice and replace it with Sherlock Holmes. Chaplin had so pleased Gillette with his performance in The Painful Predicament that he was kept on as Billy for the full play.{{sfn Robinson pp=59–60}} group=note}} "It was like tidings from heaven", Chaplin recalled.{{sfn Chaplin p=89}} At 16 years old, Chaplin starred in the plays West End production at the Duke of Yorks Theatre from October to December 1905.{{sfn Marriot p=217}} He completed one final tour of Sherlock Holmes in early 1906, before leaving the play after more than two-and-a-half years.{{sfn Robinson p=63}}

====Stage comedy and vaudeville====
Chaplin soon found work with a new company, and went on tour with his brother – who was also pursuing an acting career – in a Sketch comedy comedy sketch called Repairs.{{sfn Robinson pp=63–64}} In May 1906, Chaplin joined the juvenile act Caseys Circus,{{sfn Marriot p=71}} where he developed popular burlesque pieces and was soon the star of the show. By the time the act finished touring in July 1907, the 18-year-old had become an accomplished comedic performer.{{sfnm 1a1=Robinson 1pp=64–68 2a1=Chaplin 2p=94}} He struggled to find more work, however, and a brief attempt at a solo act was a failure.{{refn Chaplin attempted to be a "Jewish comedian", but the act was poorly received and he performed it only once.{{sfnm 1a1=Robinson 1p=68 2a1=Marriot 2pp=81–84}} group=note}}

File:Chaplin Karno advert.jpg thumb Advertisement from Chaplins American tour with the Fred Karno comedy company, 1913

Meanwhile, Sydney Chaplin had joined Fred Karnos prestigious comedy company in 1906 and, by 1908, he was one of their key performers.{{sfnm 1a1=Robinson 1p=71 2a1=Kamin 2p=12 3a1=Marriot 3p=85}} In February, he managed to secure a two-week trial for his younger brother. Karno was initially wary, and considered Chaplin a "pale, puny, sullen-looking youngster" who "looked much too shy to do any good in the theatre."{{sfn Robinson p=76}} However, the teenager made an impact on his first night at the London Coliseum and he was quickly signed to a contract.{{sfn Robinson pp=76–77}} Chaplin began by playing a series of minor parts, eventually progressing to starring roles in 1909.{{sfn Marriot pp=103, 109}} In April 1910, he was given the lead in a new sketch, Jimmy the Fearless. It was a big success, and Chaplin received considerable press attention.{{sfnm 1a1=Marriot 1pp=126–128 2a1=Robinson 2pp=84–85}}

Karno selected his new star to join the section of the company, one that also included Stan Laurel, that toured North Americas vaudeville circuit.{{sfn Robinson p=88}} The young comedian headed the show and impressed reviewers, being described as "one of the best pantomime artists ever seen here".{{sfn Robinson pp=91–92}} His most successful role was a drunk called the "Inebriate Swell", which drew him significant recognition.{{sfnm 1a1=Robinson 1p=82 2a1=Brownlow 2p=98}} The tour lasted 21 months, and the troupe returned to England in June 1912.{{sfn Robinson p=95}} Chaplin recalled that he "had a disquieting feeling of sinking back into a depressing commonplaceness" and was, therefore, delighted when a new tour began in October.{{sfnm 1a1=Chaplin 1pp=133–134 2a1=Robinson 2p=96}}

Six months into the second American tour, Chaplin was invited to join the New York Motion Picture Company. A representative who had seen his performances thought he could replace Fred Mace, a star of their Keystone Studios who intended to leave.{{sfn Robinson p=102}} Chaplin thought the Keystone comedies "a crude mélange of rough and rumble", but liked the idea of working in films and rationalised: "Besides, it would mean a new life."{{sfn Chaplin pp=138–139}} He met with the company and signed a $150-per-week (${{Inflation US 150 1913 fmt=c}} in {{Inflation-year US}} dollars){{Inflation-fn US}} contract in September 1913.{{sfnm 1a1=Robinson 1p=103 2a1=Chaplin 2p=139}}

Chaplin arrived in Los Angeles, home of the Keystone studio, in early December 1913.{{sfn Robinson p=107}} His boss was Mack Sennett, who initially expressed concern that the 24-year-old looked too young.{{sfn Chaplin p=141}} He was not used in a picture until late January, during which time Chaplin attempted to learn the processes of filmmaking.{{sfn Robinson p=108}} The Film reel one-reeler Making a Living marked his film acting debut and was released on 2 February 1914. Chaplin strongly disliked the picture, but one review picked him out as "a comedian of the first water".{{sfn Robinson p=110}} For his second appearance in front of the camera, Chaplin selected the costume with which he became identified. He described the process in his autobiography:

{{quote "I wanted everything to be a contradiction: the pants baggy, the coat tight, the hat small and the shoes large&nbsp;... I added a small moustache, which, I reasoned, would add age without hiding my expression. I had no idea of the character. But the moment I was dressed, the clothes and the makeup made me feel the person he was. I began to know him, and by the time I walked on stage he was fully born."{{sfn Chaplin p=145}}{{refn Robinson notes that "this was not strictly true: the character was to take a year or more to evolve its full dimensions and even then – which was its particular strength – it would evolve during the whole rest of his career".{{sfn Robinson p=114}} group=note}}}}

The film was Mabels Strange Predicament, but "the Tramp" character, as it became known, debuted to audiences in Kid Auto Races at Venice – shot later than Mabels Strange Predicament but released two days earlier.{{sfn Robinson p=113}} Chaplin adopted the character as his screen persona and attempted to make suggestions for the films he appeared in. These ideas were dismissed by his directors.{{sfn Robinson p=120}} During the filming of his eleventh picture, Mabel at the Wheel, he clashed with director Mabel Normand and was almost released from his contract. Sennett kept him on, however, when he received orders from exhibitors for more Chaplin films. Sennett also allowed Chaplin to direct his next film himself after Chaplin promised to pay $1,500 (${{Inflation US 1500 1913 fmt=c}} in {{Inflation-year US}} dollars) if the film was unsuccessful.{{sfn Robinson p=121}}

Caught in the Rain, issued 4 May 1914, was Chaplins directorial debut and was highly successful.{{sfn Robinson p=123}} Thereafter he directed almost every short film in which he appeared for Keystone,{{sfn Maland (1989) p=5}} at the rate of approximately one per week,{{sfn Kamin p=xi}} a period which he later remembered as the most exciting time of his career.{{sfn Chaplin p=153}} Chaplins films introduced a slower form of comedy than the typical Keystone farce,{{sfn Robinson p=113}} and he developed a large fan base.{{sfnm 1a1=Robinson 1p=125 2a1=Maland 2y=(1989) 2pp=8–9}} In November 1914, he had a supporting role in the first feature length comedy film, Tillies Punctured Romance (1914 film) Tillies Punctured Romance, directed by Sennett and starring Marie Dressler, which was a commercial success and increased his popularity.{{sfn Robinson pp=127–128}} When Chaplins contract came up for renewal at the end of the year, he asked for $1,000 a week (${{Inflation US 1000 1913 fmt=c}} in {{Inflation-year US}} dollars) – an amount Sennett refused as too large.{{sfn Robinson p=131}}

====Essanay====

The Essanay Studios Essanay Film Manufacturing Company of Chicago sent Chaplin an offer of $1,250 a week with a signing bonus of $10,000. He joined the studio in late December 1914,{{sfn Robinson p=135}} where he began forming a stock company of regular players, including Leo White, Bud Jamison, Paddy McGuire and Billy Armstrong. He soon recruited a leading lady – Edna Purviance, whom Chaplin met in a cafe and hired on account of her beauty. She went on to appear in 35 films with Chaplin over eight years;{{sfn Robinson pp=138–139}} the pair also formed a romantic relationship that lasted into 1917.{{sfn Robinson pp=141, 219}}

Chaplin asserted a high level of control over his pictures and started to put more time and care into each film.{{sfnm 1a1=Neibaur 1p=23 2a1=Chaplin 2p=165 3a1=Robinson 3pp=140, 143}} There was a month-long interval between the release of his second production, A Night Out (1915 film) A Night Out, and his third, The Champion (1915 film) The Champion.{{sfn Robinson p=143}} The final seven of Chaplins 14 Essanay films were all produced at this slower pace.{{sfn Maland (1989) p=20}} Chaplin also began to alter his screen persona, which had attracted some criticism at Keystone for its "mean, crude, and brutish" nature.{{sfn Maland (1989) pp=6, 14–18}} The character became more gentle and romantic;{{sfn Maland (1989) pp=21–24}} The Tramp (film) The Tramp (April 1915) was considered a particular turning point in his development.{{sfnm 1a1=Robinson 1p=142 2a1=Neibaur 2pp=23–24}} The use of pathos was developed further with The Bank (1915 film) The Bank, in which Chaplin created a sad ending. Robinson notes that this was an innovation in comedy films, and marked the time when serious critics began to appreciate Chaplins work.{{sfn Robinson p=146}} At Essanay, writes film scholar Simon Louvish, Chaplin "found the themes and the settings that would define the Tramps world."{{sfn Louvish p=87}}

During 1915, Chaplin became a cultural phenomenon. Shops were stocked with Chaplin merchandise, he was featured in cartoons and comic strips, and several songs were written about him.{{sfnm 1a1=Robinson 1pp=152–153 2a1=Kamin 2p=xi 3a1=Maland 3y=(1989) 3p=10}} In July, a journalist for Motion Picture Magazine wrote that "Chaplinitis" had spread across America.{{sfn Maland (1989) p=8}} As his fame grew worldwide, he became the film industrys first international star.{{sfnm 1a1=Louvish 1p=74 2a1=Sklar 2p=72}} When the Essanay contract ended in December 1915,{{sfn Robinson p=149}}{{refn After leaving Essanay, Chaplin found himself engaged in a legal battle with the company that lasted until 1922. It began when Essanay extended his last film for them, Burlesque on Carmen, from a two-reeler to a feature film (by adding out-takes and new scenes with Leo White) without his consent. Chaplin applied for an injunction to prevent its distribution, but the case was dismissed in court. In a counter-claim, Essanay alleged that Chaplin had broken his contract by not producing the agreed number of films and sued him for $500,000 in damages. In addition, the company compiled another film, Triple Trouble (1918 film) Triple Trouble (1918), from various unused Chaplin scenes and new material shot by White.{{sfn Robinson pp=149–152}} group=note}} Chaplin – fully aware of his popularity – requested a $150,000 signing bonus from his next studio. He received several offers, including Universal Studios Universal, Fox Film Fox, and Vitagraph Studios Vitagraph, the best of which came from the Mutual Film Mutual Film Corporation at $10,000 a week.{{sfn Robinson p=156}}

====Mutual====

Freuler, the studio president, explained: "We can afford to pay Mr. Chaplin this large sum annually because the public wants Chaplin and will pay for him."{{sfn Robinson p=159}}

Mutual gave Chaplin his own Los Angeles studio to work in, which opened in March 1916.{{sfn Robinson p=164}} He added two key members to his stock company, Albert Austin and Eric Campbell (actor) Eric Campbell,{{sfn Robinson pp=165–166}} and produced a series of elaborate two-reelers: The Floorwalker, The Fireman (1916 film) The Fireman, The Vagabond (film) The Vagabond, One A.M.

The Mutual contract stipulated that he release a two-reel film every four weeks, which he had managed to achieve.

Chaplin was attacked in the British media for not fighting in the World War I First World War.{{sfn Robinson p=185}} He defended himself, revealing that he would fight for Britain if called and had registered for the American draft, but he was not summoned by either country.{{refn The British embassy made a statement saying: "[Chaplin] is of as much use to Great Britain now making big money and subscribing to war loans as he would be in the trenches."{{sfn Robinson p=186}} group=note}} Despite this criticism Chaplin was a favourite with the troops,{{sfn Robinson p=187}} and his popularity continued to grow worldwide. Harpers Weekly reported that the name of Charlie Chaplin was "a part of the common language of almost every country", and that the Tramp image was "universally familiar".{{sfn Robinson p=210}} In 1917, professional Chaplin imitators were so widespread that he took legal action,{{sfn Robinson pp=215–216}} and it was reported that nine out of ten men who attended costume parties dressed as the Tramp.{{sfn Robinson p=213}} The same year, a study by the Boston Society for Psychical Research concluded that Chaplin was "an American obsession".{{sfn Robinson p=213}} The actress Minnie Maddern Fiske wrote that "a constantly increasing body of cultured, artistic people are beginning to regard the young English buffoon, Charles Chaplin, as an extraordinary artist, as well as a comic genius".{{sfn Robinson p=210}}

Mutual was patient with Chaplins decreased rate of output, and the contract ended amicably. With his aforementioned concern about the declining quality of his films because of contract scheduling stipulations, Chaplins primary concern in finding a new distributor was independence; Sydney Chaplin, then his business manager, told the press, "Charlie [must] be allowed all the time he needs and all the money for producing [films] the way he wants&nbsp;...

A Dogs Life, released April 1918, was the first film under the new contract. In it, Chaplin demonstrated his increasing concern with story construction and his treatment of the Tramp as "a sort of Pierrot".{{sfn Chaplin p=208}} The film was described by Louis Delluc as "cinemas first total work of art".{{sfn Robinson p=229}} Chaplin then embarked on the Liberty bond#Sales difficulties and the subsequent campaign Third Liberty Bond campaign, touring the United States for one month to raise money for the Allies of the First World War.{{sfn Robinson pp=237, 241}} He also produced a short propaganda film, donated to the government for fund-raising, called The Bond.{{sfn Robinson p=244}} Chaplins next release was war-based, placing the Tramp in the trenches for Shoulder Arms.

====United Artists, Mildred Harris, and The Kid====
After the release of Shoulder Arms, Chaplin requested more money from First National, which was refused. Frustrated with their lack of concern for quality, and worried about rumours of a possible merger between the company and Famous Players-Lasky, Chaplin joined forces with Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, and D. W. Griffith to form a new distribution company – United Artists, established in January 1919.{{sfnm 1a1=Chaplin 1pp=219–220 2a1=Balio 2p=12 3a1=Robinson 3p=267}} The arrangement was revolutionary in the film industry, as it enabled the four partners – all creative artists – to personally fund their pictures and have complete control.{{sfn Robinson p=269}} Chaplin was eager to start with the new company and offered to buy out his contract with First National.

Before the creation of United Artists, Chaplin married for the first time.

Having fulfilled his First National contract, Chaplin was free to make his first picture as an independent producer. In November 1922, he began filming A Woman of Paris, a romantic drama about ill-fated lovers.{{sfn Robinson p=310}} Chaplin intended it to be a star-making vehicle for Edna Purviance,{{sfn Robinson p=302}} and did not appear in the picture himself other than in a brief, uncredited cameo.{{sfn Robinson pp=311–312}} He wished the film to have a realistic feel and directed his cast to give restrained performances. In real life, he explained, "men and women try to hide their emotions rather than seek to express them".{{sfn Robinson pp=319–321}} A Woman of Paris premiered in September 1923 and was acclaimed for its innovative, subtle approach.{{sfn Robinson pp=318–321}} The public, however, seemed to have little interest in a Chaplin film without Chaplin, and it was a box office bomb box office disappointment.{{sfn Louvish p=193}} The filmmaker was hurt by this failure – he had long wanted to produce a dramatic film and was proud of the result – and soon withdrew A Woman of Paris from circulation.{{sfn Robinson pp=302, 322}}

Chaplin returned to comedy for his next project. Setting his standards high, he told himself "This next film must be an epic! The Greatest!"{{sfn Louvish p=195}} Inspired by a photograph of the 1898 Klondike Gold Rush, and later the story of the Donner Party of 1846–47, he made what Geoffrey Macnab calls "an epic comedy out of grim subject matter."{{sfnm 1a1=Kemp 1p=64 2a1=Chaplin 2p=299}} In The Gold Rush, the Tramp is a lonely prospecting prospector fighting adversity and looking for love.

====Lita Grey and The Circus====
File:Lita Grey.jpg thumb upright Lita Grey, whose bitter divorce from Chaplin caused a scandal

While making The Gold Rush, Chaplin married for the second time. Mirroring the circumstances of his first union, Lita Grey was a teenage actress, originally set to star in the film, whose surprise announcement of pregnancy forced Chaplin into marriage. She was 16 and he was 35, meaning Chaplin could have been charged with statutory rape under California law.{{sfn Robinson p=346}} He therefore arranged a discreet marriage in Mexico on 25 November 1924.{{sfnm 1a1=Chaplin and Vance 1p=53 2a1=Vance 2y=(2003) 2p=170}} Their first son, Charles Chaplin Jr. Charles Spencer Chaplin, Jr., was born on 5 May 1925, followed by Sydney Chaplin (American actor) Sydney Earl Chaplin on 30 March 1926.{{sfn Robinson pp=355, 368}}

It was an unhappy marriage, and Chaplin spent long hours at the studio to avoid seeing his wife.{{sfn Robinson pp=350, 368}} In November 1926, Grey took the children and left the family home.{{sfn Robinson p=371}} A bitter divorce followed, in which Greys application – accusing Chaplin of infidelity, abuse, and of harbouring "perverted sexual desires" – was leaked to the press.{{sfnm 1a1=Louvish 1p=220 2a1=Robinson 2pp=372–374}}{{refn In her memoirs, Lita Grey later claimed that many of her complaints were "cleverly, shockingly enlarged upon or distorted" by her lawyers.{{sfn Maland (1989) p=96}} group=note}} Chaplin was reported to be in a state of nervous breakdown, as the story became headline news and groups formed across America calling for his films to be banned.{{sfnm 1a1=Robinson 1pp=372–374 2a1=Louvish 2pp=220–221}} Eager to end the case without further scandal, Chaplins lawyers agreed to a cash settlement of $600,000{{snds}}the largest awarded by American courts at that time.{{sfn Robinson p=378}} His fan base was strong enough to survive the incident, and it was soon forgotten, but Chaplin was deeply affected by it.{{sfnm 1a1=Maland 1y=(1989) 1pp=99–105 2a1=Robinson 2p=383}}

By the time The Circus was released, Hollywood had witnessed the introduction of sound films.

====Travels, Paulette Goddard, and Modern Times====
City Lights had been a success, but Chaplin was unsure if he could make another picture without dialogue. He remained convinced that sound would not work in his films, but was also "obsessed by a depressing fear of being old-fashioned."{{sfn Chaplin p=360}} In this state of uncertainty, early in 1931, the comedian decided to take a holiday and ended up travelling for 16 months.{{sfnm 1a1=Louvish 1p=243 2a1=Robinson 2p=420}}{{refn Chaplin left the United States on 31 January 1931, and returned on 10 June 1932.{{sfn Robinson pp=664–666}} group=note}} He spent months travelling Western Europe, including extended stays in France and Switzerland, and spontaneously decided to visit Japan.{{sfn Robinson pp=429–441}} The day after he arrived in Japan, Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi was assassinated by ultra-nationalists in the May 15 Incident.

In his autobiography, Chaplin recalled that on his return to Los Angeles, "I was confused and without plan, restless and conscious of an extreme loneliness". He briefly considered retiring and moving to China.{{sfn Chaplin pp=372, 375}} Chaplins loneliness was relieved when he met 21-year-old actress Paulette Goddard in July 1932, and the pair began a relationship.{{sfnm 1a1=Robinson 1p=453 2a1=Maland 2y=(1989) 2p=147}} He was not ready to commit to a film, however, and focused on writing a Serial (literature) serial about his travels (published in Womans Home Companion).{{sfn Robinson p=451}} The trip had been a stimulating experience for Chaplin, including meetings with several prominent thinkers, and he became increasingly interested in world affairs.{{sfn Louvish p=256}} The state of labour in America troubled him, and he feared that capitalism and machinery in the workplace would increase unemployment levels. It was these concerns that stimulated Chaplin to develop his new film.{{sfnm 1a1=Larcher 1p=63 2a1=Robinson 2pp=457–458}}

Modern Times (film) Modern Times was announced by Chaplin as "a satire on certain phases of our industrial life."{{sfn Louvish p=257}} Featuring the Tramp and Goddard as they endure the Great Depression, it took ten and a half months to film.{{sfn Robinson p=465}} Chaplin intended to use spoken dialogue but changed his mind during rehearsals.

The 1940s saw Chaplin face a series of controversies, both in his work and in his personal life, which changed his fortunes and severely affected his popularity in the United States. The first of these was his growing boldness in expressing his political beliefs. Deeply disturbed by the Fascism#International impact of the Great Depression and the buildup to World War II surge of militaristic nationalism in 1930s world politics,{{sfnm 1a1=Robinson 1p=485 2a1=Maland 2y=(1989) 2p=159}} Chaplin found that he could not keep these issues out of his work.{{sfn Chaplin p=386}}  Parallels between himself and Adolf Hitler had been widely noted: the pair were born four days apart, both had risen from poverty to world prominence, and Hitler wore the same toothbrush moustache as Chaplin. It was this physical resemblance that supplied the plot for Chaplins next film, The Great Dictator, which directly satirised Hitler and attacked fascism.{{sfnm 1a1=Schickel 1p=28 2a1=Maland 2y=(1989) 2pp=165, 170 3a1=Louvish 3p=271 4a1=Robinson 4p=490 5a1=Larcher 5p=67 6a1=Kemp 6p=158}}

Chaplin spent two years developing the script,{{sfn Chaplin p=388}} and began filming in September 1939 – six days after Britain declared war on Germany.{{sfn Robinson p=496}} He had submitted to using spoken dialogue, partly out of acceptance that he had no other choice, but also because he recognised it as a better method for delivering a political message.{{sfn Maland (1989) p=165}} Making a comedy about Hitler was seen as highly controversial, but Chaplins financial independence allowed him to take the risk.{{sfn Maland (1989) p=164}} "I was determined to go ahead," he later wrote, "for Hitler must be laughed at."{{sfn Chaplin p=387}}{{refn Chaplin later said that if he had known the extent of the Nazi Partys actions he would not have made the film; "Had I known the actual horrors of the German concentration camps, I could not have made The Great Dictator; I could not have made fun of the homicidal insanity of the Nazis."{{sfn Chaplin p=388}} group=note}} Chaplin replaced the Tramp (while wearing similar attire) with "A Jewish Barber", a reference to the Nazi partys belief that he was Jewish.{{refn Speculation about Chaplins racial origin existed from the earliest days of his fame, and it was often reported that he was a Jew. Research has uncovered no evidence of this, and when a reporter asked in 1915 if it was true, Chaplin responded, "I have not that good fortune."

====Legal troubles and Oona ONeill====
In the mid-1940s, Chaplin was involved in a series of trials that occupied most of his time and significantly affected his public image.{{sfn Maland (1989) pp=197–198}} The troubles stemmed from his affair with an aspirant actress named Joan Barry (American actress) Joan Barry, with whom he was involved intermittently between June 1941 and the autumn of 1942.{{sfn Maland (1989) p=200}} Barry, who displayed obsessive behaviour and was twice arrested after they separated,{{refn In December 1942, Barry broke into Chaplins home with a handgun and threatened suicide while holding him at gunpoint. This lasted until the next morning, when Chaplin was able to get the gun from her. Barry broke into Chaplins home a second time later that month, and he had her arrested. She was then prosecuted for wikt:vagrant vagrancy in January 1943 – Barry had been unable to pay her hotel bills, and was found wandering the streets of Beverly Hills after taking an overdose of barbiturates.{{sfn Maland (1989) pp=198–201}} group=note}} reappeared the following year and announced that she was pregnant with Chaplins child. As Chaplin denied the claim, Barry filed a paternity suit against him.{{sfn Maland (1989) pp=198–201}}

The director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), J. Edgar Hoover, who had long been suspicious of Chaplins political leanings, used the opportunity to generate negative publicity about him. As part of a smear campaign to damage Chaplins image,{{sfn Nowell-Smith p=85}} the FBI named him in four indictments related to the Barry case. Most serious of these was an alleged violation of the Mann Act, which prohibits the transportation of women across state boundaries for sexual purposes.{{refn According to the prosecutor, Chaplin had violated the act when he paid for Barrys trip to New York in October 1942, when he was also visiting the city. Both Chaplin and Barry agreed that they had met there briefly, and according to Barry, they had sexual intercourse.{{sfn Maland (1989) pp=204–205}} Chaplin claimed that the last time he was intimate with Barry was May 1942.{{sfn Robinson pp=523–524}} group=note}} The historian Otto Friedrich has called this an "absurd prosecution" of an "ancient statute",{{sfn Friedrich pp=190, 393}} yet if Chaplin was found guilty, he faced 23 years in jail.{{sfn Maland (1989) p=215}} Three charges lacked sufficient evidence to proceed to court, but the Mann Act trial began in March 1944.

====Monsieur Verdoux and communist accusations====
File:Monsieur Verdoux poster.jpg thumb left upright Monsieur Verdoux (1947), a dark comedy about a serial killer, marked a significant departure for Chaplin. He was so unpopular at the time of release that it flopped in the United States.

Chaplin claimed that the Barry trials had "crippled [his] creativeness", and it was some time before he began working again.{{sfn Chaplin p=426}} In April 1946, he finally began filming a project that had been in development since 1942.{{sfn Robinson p=520}} Monsieur Verdoux was a black comedy, the story of a French bank clerk, Verdoux (Chaplin), who loses his job and begins marrying and murdering wealthy widows to support his family. Chaplins inspiration for the project came from Orson Welles, who wanted him to star in a film about the French serial killer Henri Désiré Landru. Chaplin decided that the concept would "make a wonderful comedy",{{sfn Chaplin p=412}} and paid Welles $5,000 for the idea.{{sfn Robinson pp=519–520}}

Chaplin again vocalised his political views in Monsieur Verdoux, criticising capitalism and arguing that the world encourages mass killing through wars and Weapon of mass destruction weapons of mass destruction.{{sfnm 1a1=Louvish 1p=304 2a1=Sbardellati and Shaw 2p=501}} Because of this, the film met with controversy when it was released in April 1947;{{sfnm 1a1=Louvish 1pp=296–297 2a1=Robinson 2pp=538–543 3a1=Larcher 3p=77}} Chaplin was booed at the premiere, and there were calls for a boycott.{{sfnm 1a1=Louvish 1pp=296–297 2a1=Sbardellati and Shaw 2p=503}} Monsieur Verdoux was the first Chaplin release that failed both critically and commercially in the United States.{{sfn Maland (1989) pp=235–245, 250}} It was more successful abroad,{{sfn Maland (1989) p=250}} and Chaplins screenplay was nominated at the 20th Academy Awards Academy Awards.{{sfn Louvish p=297}} He was proud of the film, writing in his autobiography, "Monsieur Verdoux is the cleverest and most brilliant film I have yet made."{{sfn Chaplin p=444}}

The negative reaction to Monsieur Verdoux was largely the result of changes in Chaplins public image.{{sfn Maland (1989) p=251}} Along with damage of the Joan Barry scandal, he was publicly accused of being a communist.{{sfnm 1a1=Robinson 1pp=538–539 2a1=Friedrich 2p=287}} His political activity had heightened during World War II, when he campaigned for the opening of a Second Front to help the Soviet Union and supported various Soviet–American friendship groups.{{sfn Maland (1989) p=253}} He was also friendly with several suspected communists, and attended functions given by Soviet diplomats in Los Angeles.{{sfn Maland (1989) pp=221–226, 253–254}} In the political climate of 1940s America, such activities meant Chaplin was considered, as Larcher writes, "dangerously progressivism progressive and amoral."{{sfnm 1a1=Larcher 1p=75 2a1=Sbardellati and Shaw 2p=506 3a1=Louvish 3p=xiii}} The FBI wanted him out of the country,{{sfn Sbardellati p=152}} and launched an official investigation in early 1947.{{sfn Maland (1989) pp=265–266}}{{refn Chaplin had already attracted the attention of the FBI long before the 1940s, the first mention of him in their files being from 1922. J. Edgar Hoover first requested that a Security Index Card be filed for Chaplin in September 1946, but the Los Angeles office was slow to react and only began active investigation the next spring.{{sfn Maland (1989) pp=265–266}} The FBI also requested and received help from MI5, particularly on investigating the false claims that Chaplin had not been born in England but in France or Eastern Europe, and that his real name was Israel Thornstein.

Rankin, who helped establish HUAC, told United States Congress Congress in June 1947: "[Chaplins] very life in Hollywood is detrimental to the moral fabric of America. [If he is deported]&nbsp;... his loathsome pictures can be kept from before the eyes of the American youth. He should be deported and gotten rid of at once."{{sfn Robinson p=545}}

====Limelight and banning from the United States====
File:Limelight promo crop.jpg thumb Limelight (1952 film) Limelight (1952) was a serious and autobiographical film for Chaplin: his character, Calvero, is an ex music hall star (described in this image as a "Tramp Comedian") forced to deal with his loss of popularity.

Although Chaplin remained politically active in the years following the failure of Monsieur Verdoux,{{refn In November 1947, Chaplin asked Pablo Picasso to hold a demonstration outside the US embassy in Paris to protest the deportation proceedings of Hanns Eisler, and in December, he took part in a petition asking for the deportation process to be dropped. In 1948, Chaplin supported the unsuccessful presidential campaign of Henry A. Wallace Henry Wallace; and in 1949 he supported two peace conferences and signed a petition protesting the Peekskill Riots Peekskill incident.{{sfn Maland (1989) pp=256–257}} group=note}} his next film, about a forgotten vaudeville comedian and a young ballerina in Edwardian era Edwardian London, was devoid of political themes. Limelight (1952 film) Limelight was heavily autobiographical, alluding not only to Chaplins childhood and the lives of his parents, but also to his loss of popularity in the United States.{{sfnm 1a1=Maland 1y=(1989) 1pp=288–290 2a1=Robinson 2pp=551–552 3a1=Louvish 3p=312}} The cast included various members of his family, including his five oldest children and his half-brother, Wheeler Dryden.{{sfn Maland (1989) p=293}}

Filming began in November 1951, by which time Chaplin had spent three years working on the story.{{sfn Louvish p=317}}{{refn Limelight was conceived as a novel, which Chaplin wrote but never intended for publication.{{sfn Robinson pp=549–570}} group=note}} He aimed for a more serious tone than any of his previous films, regularly using the word "melancholy" when explaining his plans to his co-star Claire Bloom.{{sfn Robinson p=562}} Limelight featured a cameo appearance from Buster Keaton, whom Chaplin cast as his stage partner in a pantomime scene. This marked the only time the comedians worked together.{{sfn Robinson pp=567–568}}

Chaplin decided to hold the world premiere of Limelight in London, since it was the setting of the film.{{sfn Louvish p=326}} As he left Los Angeles, he expressed a premonition that he would not be returning.{{sfn Robinson p=570}} At New York, he boarded the {{RMS Queen Elizabeth}} with his family on 18 September 1952.{{sfn Maland (1989) p=280}} The next day, United States Attorney General attorney general James P. McGranery revoked Chaplins re-entry permit and stated that he would have to submit to an interview concerning his political views and moral behaviour in order to re-enter the US.{{sfn Maland (1989) p=280}} Although McGranery told the press that he had "a pretty good case against Chaplin", Maland has concluded, on the basis of the FBI files that were released in the 1980s, that the US government had no real evidence to prevent Chaplins re-entry. It is likely that he would have gained entry if he had applied for it.{{sfnm 1a1=Maland 1y=(1989) 1pp=280–287 2a1=Sbardellati and Shaw 2pp=520–521}} However, when Chaplin received a cablegram informing him of the news, he privately decided to cut his ties with the United States:

{{quote Whether I re-entered that unhappy country or not was of little consequence to me. I would like to have told them that the sooner I was rid of that hate-beleaguered atmosphere the better, that I was fed up of Americas insults and moral pomposity...{{sfn Chaplin p=455}}}}

Because all of his property remained in America, Chaplin refrained from saying anything negative about the incident to the press.{{sfn Robinson p=573}} The scandal attracted vast attention,{{sfn Louvish p=330}} but Chaplin and his film were warmly received in Europe.{{sfn Maland (1989) p=280}} In America, the hostility towards him continued, and, although it received some positive reviews, Limelight was subjected to a wide-scale boycott.{{sfn Maland (1989) pp=295–298, 307–311}} Reflecting on this, Maland writes that Chaplins fall, from an "unprecedented" level of popularity, "may be the most dramatic in the history of stardom in America".{{sfn Maland (1989) p=189}}

His son, Michael, was cast as a boy whose parents are targeted by the FBI, while Chaplins character faces accusations of communism.{{sfn Louvish pp=xiv–xv}} The political satire parodied HUAC and attacked elements of 1950s culture – including consumerism, plastic surgery, and wide-screen cinema.{{sfnm 1a1=Louvish 1p=341 2a1=Maland 2y=(1989) 2pp=320–321 3a1=Robinson 3pp=588–589 4a1=Larcher 4pp=89–90}} In a review, the playwright John Osborne called it Chaplins "most bitter" and "most openly personal" film.{{sfn Robinson pp=587–589}}

Chaplin founded a new production company, Attica, and used Shepperton Studios for the shooting.{{sfn Robinson p=585}} Filming in England proved a difficult experience, as he was used to his own Hollywood studio and familiar crew, and no longer had limitless production time. According to Robinson, this had an effect on the quality of the film.{{sfnm 1a1=Epstein 1p=137 2a1=Robinson 2p=587}} A King in New York was released in September 1957, and received mixed reviews.{{sfnm 1a1=Lynn 1p=506 2a1=Louvish 2p=342 3a1=Maland 3y=(1989) 3p=322}} Chaplin banned American journalists from its Paris première and decided not to release the film in the United States.

====Final works and renewed appreciation====

In the last two decades of his career, Chaplin concentrated on re-editing and scoring his old films for re-release, along with securing their ownership and distribution rights.{{sfn Maland (1989) p=326}} In an interview he granted in 1959, the year of his 70th birthday, Chaplin stated that there was still "room for the Little Man in the atomic age".{{sfn Robinson pp=594–595}} The first of these re-releases was The Chaplin Revue (1959), which included new versions of A Dogs Life, Shoulder Arms, and The Pilgrim.{{sfn Robinson pp=594–595}}

In America, the political atmosphere began to change and attention was once again directed to Chaplins films instead of his views.{{sfn Maland (1989) p=326}} In July 1962, The New York Times published an editorial stating that "we do not believe the Republic would be in danger if yesterdays unforgotten little tramp were allowed to amble down the gangplank of a steamer or plane in an American port".{{sfn Lynn pp=507–508}} The same month, Chaplin was invested with the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters by the universities of University of Oxford Oxford and Durham University Durham.{{sfn Robinson pp=598–599}} In November 1963, the Plaza Theater in New York started a year-long series of Chaplins films, including Monsieur Verdoux and Limelight, which gained excellent reviews from American critics.{{sfnm 1a1=Lynn 1p=509 2a1=Maland 2y=(1989) 2p=330}} September 1964 saw the release of Chaplins memoirs, My Autobiography (Chaplin) My Autobiography, which he had been working on since 1957.{{sfn Robinson pp=602–605}} The 500-page book, which focused on his early years and personal life, became a worldwide best-seller, despite criticism over the lack of information on his film career.{{sfnm 1a1=Robinson 1pp=605–607 2a1=Lynn 2pp=510–512}}

Shortly after the publication of his memoirs, Chaplin began work on A Countess from Hong Kong (1967), a romantic comedy based on a script he had written for Paulette Goddard in the 1930s.{{sfn Robinson pp=608–609}} Set on an ocean liner, it starred Marlon Brando as an American ambassador and Sophia Loren as a stowaway found in his cabin.{{sfn Robinson pp=608–609}} The film differed from Chaplins earlier productions in several aspects. It was his first to use Technicolor and the widescreen format, while he concentrated on directing and appeared on-screen only in a cameo role as a seasick steward.{{sfn Robinson p=612}} He also signed a deal with Universal Studios Universal Pictures and appointed his assistant, Jerome Epstein, as the producer.{{sfn Robinson p=607}} Chaplin was paid $600,000 directors fee as well as a percentage of the gross receipts.{{sfn Vance (2003) p=330}} A Countess from Hong Kong premiered in January 1967, to unfavourable reviews, and was a box-office failure.{{sfn Epstein pp=192–196}}{{sfnm 1a1=Lynn 1p=518 2a1=Maland 2y=(1989) 2p=335}} Chaplin was deeply hurt by the negative reaction to the film, which turned out to be his last.{{sfn Epstein pp=192–196}}

==Filmmaking==
===Influences===
Chaplin believed his first influence to be his mother, who entertained him as a child by sitting at the window and mimicking passers-by: "it was through watching her that I learned not only how to express emotions with my hands and face, but also how to observe and study people."{{sfn Robinson p=18}} Chaplins early years in music hall allowed him to see stage comedians at work; he also attended the Christmas pantomimes at Theatre Royal, Drury Lane Drury Lane, where he studied the art of clowning through performers like Dan Leno.{{sfnm 1a1=Robinson 1pp=71–72 2a1=Chaplin 2pp=47–48 3a1=Weissman  3y=(2009) 3pp=82–83, 88}}  Chaplins years with the Fred Karno company had a formative effect on him as an actor and filmmaker. Simon Louvish writes that the company was his "training ground",{{sfn Louvish p=38}} and it was here that Chaplin learned to vary the pace of his comedy.{{sfn Robinson pp=86–87}} The concept of mixing pathos with slapstick was learnt from Karno,{{refn Stan Laurel, Chaplins co-performer at the company, remembered that Karnos sketches regularly inserted "a bit of sentiment right in the middle of a funny music hall turn."{{sfn Robinson pp=86–87}} group=note}} who also used elements of absurdity that became familiar in Chaplins gags.{{sfn Robinson pp=86–87}}<ref>A round-table [http://www.nrk.no/skole/?page=search&q=&mediaId=14092 Chaplin Interview] {{webarchive url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828075402/https://www.nrk.no/skole/?page=search&q=&mediaId=14092  date=28 August 2016 }} in 1952, first broadcast on BBC Radio on 15 October 1952.

===Method===
File:Chaplin Studios postcard.jpg thumb A 1922 image of Charlie Chaplin Studios, where all of Chaplins films between 1918 and 1952 were produced

Chaplin never spoke more than cursorily about his filmmaking methods, claiming such a thing would be tantamount to a magician spoiling his own illusion.{{sfn Robinson p=606}} Little was known about his working process throughout his lifetime,{{sfn Brownlow p=7}} but research from film historians – particularly the findings of Kevin Brownlow and David Gill (film historian) David Gill that were presented in the three-part documentary Unknown Chaplin (1983) – has since revealed his unique working method.{{sfnm 1a1=Louvish 1p=103 2a1=Robinson 2p=168}}

Until he began making spoken dialogue films with The Great Dictator, Chaplin never shot from a completed script.{{sfn Robinson pp=173, 197, 310, 489}} Many of his early films began with only a vague premise – for example "Charlie enters a health spa" or "Charlie works in a pawn shop."{{sfn Robinson p=169}} He then had sets constructed and worked with his stock company to improvise gags and "business" using them, almost always working the ideas out on film.{{sfnm 1a1=Louvish 1p=103 2a1=Robinson 2p=168}} As ideas were accepted and discarded, a narrative structure would emerge, frequently requiring Chaplin to reshoot an already-completed scene that might have otherwise contradicted the story.{{sfnm 1a1=Louvish 1p=168 2a1=Robinson 2pp=166–170, 489–490 3a1=Brownlow 3p=187}}{{Clarify reason=Is "pp. 489–490" assigned to author Robinson or is this citation missing an author? date=January 2017}} From A Woman of Paris onward Chaplin began the filming process with a prepared plot,{{sfn Louvish p=182}} but Robinson writes that every film up to Modern Times "went through many metamorphoses and permutations before the story took its final form."{{sfn Robinson p=460}}

Producing films in this manner meant Chaplin took longer to complete his pictures than almost any other filmmaker at the time.{{sfn Louvish p=228}} If he was out of ideas, he often took a break from the shoot, which could last for days, while keeping the studio ready for when inspiration returned.{{sfnm 1a1=Robinson 1pp=234–235 2a1=Cousins 2p=71}} Delaying the process further was Chaplins rigorous perfectionism.{{sfnm 1a1=Robinson 1pp=172, 177, 235, 311, 381, 399 2a1=Brownlow 2pp=59, 75, 82, 92, 147}} According to his friend Ivor Montagu, "nothing but perfection would be right" for the filmmaker.{{sfn Brownlow p=82}} Because he personally funded his films, Chaplin was at liberty to strive for this goal and shoot as many takes as he wished.{{sfnm 1a1=Robinson 1pp=235, 311, 223 2a1=Brownlow 2p=82}} The number was often excessive, for instance 53 takes for every finished take in The Kid.{{sfnm 1a1=Robinson 1p=746 2a1=Maland 2y=(1989) 2p=359}} For The Immigrant, a 20 minute-short, Chaplin shot 40,000 feet of film – enough for a feature-length.{{sfnm 1a1=Robinson 1p=201 2a1=Brownlow 2p=192}}

Describing his working method as "sheer perseverance to the point of madness",{{sfn Louvish p=225}} Chaplin would be completely consumed by the production of a picture.{{sfnm 1a1=Brownlow 1p=157 2a1=Robinson 2pp=121, 469}} Robinson writes that even in Chaplins later years, his work continued "to take precedence over everything and everyone else."{{sfn Robinson p=600}} The combination of story improvisation and relentless perfectionism – which resulted in days of effort and thousands of feet of film being wasted, all at enormous expense – often proved taxing for Chaplin who, in frustration, would lash out at his actors and crew.{{sfnm 1a1=Robinson 1pp=371, 362, 469, 613 2a1=Brownlow 2pp=56, 136 3a1=Schickel 3p=8}}

Chaplin exercised complete control over his pictures,{{sfn Robinson p=606}} to the extent that he would act out the other roles for his cast, expecting them to imitate him exactly.{{sfnm 1a1=Bloom 1p=101 2a1=Brownlow 2pp=59, 98, 138, 154 3a1=Robinson 3p=614}}  He personally edited all of his films, trawling through the large amounts of footage to create the exact picture he wanted.{{sfn Robinson pp=140, 235, 236}} As a result of his complete independence, he was identified by the film historian Andrew Sarris as one of the first Auteurism auteur filmmakers.{{sfn Maland (1989) p=353}} Chaplin did receive help, notably from his long-time cinematographer Roland Totheroh, brother Sydney Chaplin, and various assistant directors such as Harry Crocker and Charles Reisner.<ref>{{cite web url=http://chaplin.bfi.org.uk/programme/essays/collaborators.html  title=Chaplins Writing and Directing Collaborators  publisher=British Film Institute  accessdate=27 June 2012  deadurl=no  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214092650/http://chaplin.bfi.org.uk/programme/essays/collaborators.html  archivedate=14 February 2012  df= }}</ref>

===Style and themes===
File:The Kid scenes.ogv thumb upright=1.15 A collection of scenes from The Kid (1921 film) The Kid (1921), demonstrating Chaplins mixture of slapstick, pathos, and social commentary

While Chaplins comedic style is broadly defined as slapstick,{{sfn Robinson p=212}} it is considered restrained and intelligent,{{sfn Brownlow p=30}} with the film historian Philip Kemp describing his work as a mix of "deft, balletic physical comedy and thoughtful, situation-based gags".{{sfn Kemp p=63}} Chaplin diverged from conventional slapstick by slowing the pace and exhausting each scene of its comic potential, with more focus on developing the viewers relationship to the characters.{{sfn Robinson p=113}}{{sfn Mast pp=83–92}} Unlike conventional slapstick comedies, Robinson states that the comic moments in Chaplins films centre on the Tramps attitude to the things happening to him: the humour does not come from the Tramp bumping into a tree, but from his lifting his hat to the tree in apology.{{sfn Robinson p=113}} Dan Kamin writes that Chaplins "quirky mannerisms" and "serious demeanour in the midst of slapstick action" are other key aspects of his comedy,{{sfn Kamin pp=6–7}} while the surreal transformation of objects and the employment of In-camera effect in-camera trickery are also common features.{{sfnm 1a1=Mast 1pp=83–92 2a1=Kamin 2pp=33–34}}

Chaplins silent films typically follow the Tramps efforts to survive in a hostile world.{{sfn Louvish p=60}} The character lives in poverty and is frequently treated badly, but remains kind and upbeat;{{sfnm 1a1=Kemp 1p=63 2a1=Robinson 2pp=211, 352 3a1=Hansmeyer 3p=4}} defying his social position, he strives to be seen as a gentleman.{{sfn Robinson p=203}} As Chaplin said in 1925, "The whole point of the Little Fellow is that no matter how down on his ass he is, no matter how well the jackals succeed in tearing him apart, hes still a man of dignity."{{sfn Weissman (2009) p=47}} The Tramp defies authority figures{{sfn Dale p=17}} and "gives as good as he gets",{{sfn Weissman (2009) p=47}} leading Robinson and Louvish to see him as a representative for the underprivileged – an "everyman turned heroic saviour".{{sfnm 1a1=Robinson 1pp=455, 485 2a1=Louvish 2p=138 2ps= (for quote).}} Hansmeyer notes that several of Chaplins films end with "the homeless and lonely Tramp [walking] optimistically&nbsp;... into the sunset&nbsp;... to continue his journey".{{sfn Hansmeyer p=4}}

{{Quote box

The infusion of pathos is a well-known aspect of Chaplins work,{{sfnm 1a1=Dale 1pp=9, 19, 20 2a1=Louvish 2p=203}} and Larcher notes his reputation for "[inducing] laughter and tears".{{sfn Larcher p=75}} Sentimentality in his films comes from a variety of sources, with Louvish pinpointing "personal failure, societys strictures, economic disaster, and the elements."{{sfn Louvish p=204}} Chaplin sometimes drew on tragic events when creating his films, as in the case of The Gold Rush (1925), which was inspired by the fate of the Donner Party.{{sfn Robinson pp=334–335}} Constance B. Kuriyama has identified serious underlying themes in the early comedies, such as greed (The Gold Rush) and loss (The Kid).{{sfn Kuriyama p=31}} Chaplin also touched on controversial issues: immigration (The Immigrant, 1917); illegitimacy (The Kid, 1921); and drug use (Easy Street, 1917).{{sfn Mast pp=83–92}} He often explored these topics ironically, making comedy out of suffering.{{sfn Louvish pp=137, 145}}

Social commentary was a feature of Chaplins films from early in his career, as he portrayed the underdog in a sympathetic light and highlighted the difficulties of the poor.{{sfn Robinson p=599}} Later, as he developed a keen interest in economics and felt obliged to publicise his views,{{sfn Robinson p=456}} Chaplin began incorporating overtly political messages into his films.{{sfn Maland (1989) p=159}} Modern Times (1936) depicted factory workers in dismal conditions, The Great Dictator (1940) parodied Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini and ended in a speech against nationalism, Monsieur Verdoux (1947) criticised war and capitalism, and A King in New York (1957) attacked McCarthyism.{{sfn Larcher pp=62–89}}

Several of Chaplins films incorporate autobiographical elements, and the psychologist Sigmund Freud believed that Chaplin "always plays only himself as he was in his dismal youth".{{sfn Weissman (1999) pp=439–445}} The Kid is thought to reflect Chaplins childhood trauma of being sent into an orphanage,{{sfn Weissman (1999) pp=439–445}} the main characters in Limelight (1952) contain elements from the lives of his parents,{{sfn Bloom p=107}} and A King in New York references Chaplins experiences of being shunned by the United States.{{sfn Robinson pp=588–589}} Many of his sets, especially in street scenes, bear a strong similarity to Kennington, where he grew up. Stephen M. Weissman has argued that Chaplins problematic relationship with his mentally ill mother was often reflected in his female characters and the Tramps desire to save them.{{sfn Weissman (1999) pp=439–445}}

Regarding the structure of Chaplins films, the scholar Gerald Mast sees them as consisting of sketches tied together by the same theme and setting, rather than having a tightly unified storyline.{{sfn Mast pp=123–128}} Visually, his films are simple and economic,{{sfnm 1a1=Louvish 1p=298 2a1=Robinson 2p=592}} with scenes portrayed as if set on a stage.{{sfnm 1a1=Epstein 1pp=84–85 2a1=Mast 2pp=83–92 3a1=Louvish 3p=185}} His approach to filming was described by the art director Eugène Lourié: "Chaplin did not think in artistic images when he was shooting. He believed that action is the main thing. The camera is there to photograph the actors".{{sfn Robinson p=565}} In his autobiography, Chaplin wrote, "Simplicity is best&nbsp;... pompous effects slow up action, are boring and unpleasant&nbsp;... The camera should not intrude."{{sfn Chaplin p=250}}  This approach has prompted criticism, since the 1940s, for being "old fashioned",{{sfnm 1a1=Brownlow 1p=91 2a1=Louvish 2p=298 3a1=Kamin 3p=35}} while the film scholar Donald McCaffrey sees it as an indication that Chaplin never completely understood film as a medium.{{sfn McCaffrey pp=82–95}} Kamin, however, comments that Chaplins comedic talent would not be enough to remain funny on screen if he did not have an "ability to conceive and direct scenes specifically for the film medium".{{sfn Kamin p=29}}

===Composing===
File:Charlie Chaplin playing the cello 1915.jpg thumb upright Chaplin playing the cello in 1915

Chaplin developed a passion for music as a child and taught himself to play the piano, violin, and cello.{{sfnm 1a1=Robinson 1p=411 2a1=Louvish 2pp=17–18}} He considered the musical accompaniment of a film to be important,{{sfn Robinson pp=382}} and from A Woman of Paris onwards he took an increasing interest in this area.{{sfn Robinson p=411}} With the advent of sound technology, Chaplin began using a synchronised orchestral soundtrack – composed by himself – for City Lights (1931). He thereafter composed the scores for all of his films, and from the late 1950s to his death, he scored all of his silent features and some of his short films.{{sfn Vance (2000) p=xiii}}

As Chaplin was not a trained musician, he could not read sheet music and needed the help of professional composers, such as David Raksin, Raymond Rasch and Eric James (arranger) Eric James, when creating his scores. Musical directors were employed to oversee the recording process, such as Alfred Newman (composer) Alfred Newman for City Lights.{{sfn Slowik p=133}} Although some critics have claimed that credit for his film music should be given to the composers who worked with him, Raksin – who worked with Chaplin on Modern Times – stressed Chaplins creative position and active participation in the composing process.{{sfn Raksin and Berg pp=47–50}} This process, which could take months, would start with Chaplin describing to the composer(s) exactly what he wanted and singing or playing tunes he had improvised on the piano.{{sfn Raksin and Berg pp=47–50}} These tunes were then developed further in a close collaboration among the composer(s) and Chaplin.{{sfn Raksin and Berg pp=47–50}} According to film historian Jeffrey Vance, "although he relied upon associates to arrange varied and complex instrumentation, the musical imperative is his, and not a note in a Chaplin musical score was placed there without his assent."<ref name="VarietyVance">Vance, Jeffrey (4 August 2003). "Chaplin the Composer: An Excerpt from Chaplin: Genius of the Cinema". Variety Special Advertising Supplement, pp. 20–21.</ref>

Chaplins compositions produced three popular songs. "Smile (Charlie Chaplin song) Smile", composed originally for Modern Times (1936) and later set to lyrics by John Turner (lyricist) John Turner and Geoffrey Parsons (lyricist) Geoffrey Parsons, was a hit for Nat King Cole in 1954.<ref name="VarietyVance"/> For Limelight, Chaplin composed "Terrys Theme", which was popularised by Jimmy Young (broadcaster) Jimmy Young as "Eternally (Charles Chaplin song) Eternally" (1952).{{sfn Kamin p=198}} Finally, "This Is My Song (1967 song) This Is My Song", performed by Petula Clark for A Countess from Hong Kong (1967), reached number one on the UK and other European charts.<ref>Hennessy, Mike (22 April 1967).

Following the end of Will &amp; Grace, McCormack starred on the New York stage opposite Fran Drescher, Judy Reyes, Brooke Smith (actress) Brooke Smith, and Maura Tierney, in Neil LaButes Off Broadway off-Broadway play Some Girl(s) at the Lucille Lortel Theatre.
He plays a writer who is ready to settle down and marry, but decides to visit four ex-girlfriends first. For his performance, McCormack received critical reviews. New York Times contributor Ben Brantley, in review of the production, wrote: "Playing a thoughtless, woman-despising heterosexual, Mr. McCormack isnt much different from when he was playing a thoughtful, woman-worshiping homosexual. As in Will &amp; Grace, he italicizes every other line for maximum comic spin and punctuates his dialogue by earnestly furrowing his features".
Brantley went on to say that McCormacks interpretation of the character is "certainly a more slickly sustained performance" than the one delivered by David Schwimmer in 2005.
Melissa Rose Bernardo of Entertainment Weekly commented that McCormack and Maura Tierney "have incredible chemistry".
In the same year, McCormack produced the Lifetime Television Lifetime comedy Lovespring International, a show that revolves around six employees at Lovespring International, a dating agency located in California as an "elite Beverly Hills" company.
The series debuted to ambivalent reviews,
with Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe commenting that Lovespring International is "a lively little cable exercise in over-the-top characters, bad taste, satire, and political incorrectness."
The show was cancelled that same year.

In the miniseries, he played Jack Nash, a television reporter who battles an addiction to cocaine. The Andromeda Strain received mixed reviews,
and McCormacks performance was criticized. Joanna Weiss of the Boston Globe wrote, "The presence of Eric McCormack, as an intrepid TV reporter, is especially extraneous (no disrespect to intrepid reporters)."
Robert Bianco of USA Today commented, "The central cast is completed by ... poor Eric McCormack as a crusading, coke-addicted journalist who spends the second half of the movie playing Rambo in the desert. Lets just say McCormack does the best he can with what hes given, and leave it at that."
On September 5, 2008, McCormack made a guest appearance in the seventh season and 100th episode of the television series Monk (TV series) Monk, where he played an unctuous host of a television crime docudrama.

McCormacks decision to do the show was due to "great writing".
The show debuted on January 26, 2009, and was watched by almost 3.4 million viewers.
Trust Me debuted to very positive reviews, with Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle writing, "...the series is surprisingly solid."
Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times wrote that McCormack and Cavanagh "manage to keep their characters sharply defined but low-key. They are opposites but not in an ash-smudged, Windex-wielding Felix and Oscar way."
The series, however, was cancelled after one season, due to poor ratings.
McCormack starred in the science-fiction film Alien Trespass (2009), in which he played Doctor Ted Lewis, who gets possessed by an alien marshal, Urp, after he crash-lands on Earth.

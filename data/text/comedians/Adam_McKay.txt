==Career==

===Writing, acting, and producing===
McKay originally auditioned for Saturday Night Live to be an onscreen performer, but did not make the cut. However, the scripts he submitted to the long-running sketch show earned him a job as writer from 1995 to 2001, including two seasons as head writer. He also directed a number of short films for the show, including the original SNL Digital Shorts. McKay encouraged his Second City friend Tina Fey to submit some of her scripts to Saturday Night Live, and she later succeeded him as head writer on the show. Though McKay was never an actual SNL cast member, he did make several on-camera appearances over the years and had a recurring role as an obnoxious audience member named "Keith" who would often shout insults at the celebrity hosts during their opening monologue.

Shortly after leaving SNL, McKay teamed up with comedian Will Ferrell to write the comedy films Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2004), Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (2006), Step Brothers (film) Step Brothers (2008), and The Other Guys (2010), all of which he also directed, produced and made cameo appearances in as an actor.

A video on the site, titled The Landlord (2007 film) The Landlord<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/74 title=Will Ferrell and Pearl in The Landlord}}</ref> features both him and his young daughter, Pearl, whom Ferrell and his wife bait to say curse words.

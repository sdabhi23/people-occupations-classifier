==Early life and career==

The Batman story hooked me for life. A couple of years later my family emigrated to Canada (for the second time, no less!) and I discovered the vast array of American comics available at the time.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.byrnerobotics.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=5806&KW=Bromwich  title=Journey into Comics  first=John  last=Byrne  date=May 14, 2005  publisher=Byrne Robotics  archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AgSlViN6?url=http://www.byrnerobotics.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID%3D5806%26KW%3DBromwich  archivedate=September 15, 2012  accessdate=September 14, 2012  deadurl=no df=mdy-all}}</ref>}}

His first encounter with Marvel Comics was in 1962 with Stan Lee and Jack Kirbys Fantastic Four (comic book) Fantastic Four #5.<ref>"Avengers Assemble: Question of the Month", Avengers #233 (July 1983) Marvel Comics</ref> He later commented that "the book had an edge like nothing DC was putting out at the time".<ref name="CBR2000">{{cite web url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=151  title=John Byrne: The Hidden Answers  first=Michael  last=Thomas  date=August 22, 2000  publisher=Comic Book Resources  archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AgTRc63p?url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page%3Darticle%26id%3D151  archivedate=September 15, 2012  deadurl=no df=mdy-all accessdate=September 14, 2012  quote=FF5 blew me away on a lot of levels.

Besides Kirby, Byrne was influenced by the naturalism (art) naturalistic style of Neal Adams.

In 1970, Byrne enrolled at the Alberta College of Art and Design in Calgary. He created the superhero parody Gay Guy for the college newspaper, which poked fun at the campus stereotype of homosexuality among art students. Gay Guy is notable for featuring a prototype of the Alpha Flight character Snowbird (comics) Snowbird. While there, he published his first comic book, ACA Comix #1, featuring "The Deaths Head Knight".<ref>{{cite book last = Cooke first = Jon B. chapter= Part 1: Drawing with a Ballpoint Pen  title = Modern Masters Volume Seven: John Byrne publisher = TwoMorrows Publishing year = 2006 location= Raleigh, North Carolina page = 18  isbn = 189390556X}}</ref>

Byrne left the college in 1973 without graduating.

A Rog-2000 story written by Stern, with art by Byrne and Layton, had gotten the attention of Charlton Comics editor Nicola Cuti, who extended Byrne an invitation. Written by Cuti, "Rog-2000" became one of several alternating backup features in the Charlton Comics superhero series E-Man, starting with the eight-page "That Was No Lady" in issue #6 (Jan. 1975). While that was Byrnes first published color-comics work, "My first professional comic book sale was to Marvel, a short story called Dark Asylum ...  which languished in a flat file somewhere until it was used as filler in The Tomb of Dracula Giant-Size Dracula #5 [(June 1975)], long after the first Rog story."<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=1&T1=Who+Is+John+Byrne%3F#7  title=What was JBs first professional job in comic books?

After the Rog-2000 story, Byrne went on to work on the Charlton books Wheelie and the Chopper Bunch, Space: 1999, and Emergency!, and co-created with writer Joe Gill the post-apocalyptic science-fiction series Doomsday + 1. Byrne additionally drew a cover for the supernatural anthology The Many Ghosts of Doctor Graves #54 (Dec. 1975).

==Marvel Comics==
Byrne said he broke into Marvel comics after writer Chris Claremont
{{bquote ...saw my [Charlton] work and began agitating for me to draw something he had written.

Hearing about the Untold Legend series, Byrne contacted editor Paul Levitz to express interest. DC took him up on his offer, but it was not until the second month of his three-month window that Byrne received the plot for the first issue. Byrne told Levitz that he would not be able to finish the project due to time constraints despite DC then allegedly offering Byrne double his Marvel pay rate, after initially saying they could not match his Marvel rate. Byrne penciled the first issue, which was inked by Jim Aparo after being intended for Terry Austin.

=== Superman ===
Near the end of his time at Marvel, Byrne was hired by DC Comics to revamp its flagship character Superman.<ref>Manning, "1980s", in Dolan, p. 221. "In the six-issue miniseries entitled [The] Man of Steel, the mammoth task of remaking Superman fell to popular writer/artist John Byrne...The result was an overwhelming success, popular with fans both old and new."</ref> This was part of a company-wide restructuring of the history of the DC Universe and all of its characters following the limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths. Byrnes reworking of Superman in particular gained widespread media coverage outside the comic book industry, including articles in Time (magazine) Time and The New York Times.

At the time, Byrne said, "Im taking Superman back to the basics ... Its basically Jerry Siegel Siegel and Joe Shuster Shusters Superman meets the Fleischer Studios Fleischer Superman in 1986."<ref name="AH">{{cite news last = Sanderson first = Peter authorlink = Peter Sanderson magazine= Amazing Heroes issue = 96 publisher = Fantagraphics Books date = June 1986}}</ref>

Byrne significantly reduced Supermans powers (though he was still one of the most powerful beings on Earth), eliminated the Fortress of Solitude and super-dog Krypto, and kept Jonathan and Martha Kent alive into Clarks adulthood to enjoy their adopted sons triumphs, as well as to provide him with support, grounding, and advice whenever he needed it. Byrne also used Marv Wolfmans idea of making Lex Luthor a wealthy business owner in addition to a scientific genius with a deadly vendetta against the superhero.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=2&T1=Questions+about+Comic+Book+Projects#31  title=Who created the new Lex Luthor for Man of Steel?  publisher=Byrnerobotics.com  date=n.d.  archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HsQIxgqV?url=http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID%3D2%26T1%3DQuestions%2Babout%2BComic%2BBook%2BProjects  archivedate=July 5, 2013  deadurl=no  accessdate=June 17, 2010 df=mdy-all}}</ref> Byrne did away with the childhood/teenage career as Superboy (Kal-El) Superboy; in his revamped history, Clark Kent does not put on a costume and become a super-hero until adulthood. This approach to Kents path to becoming Superman was later used in the action-adventure series Smallville on the WB Television Network and in the 2005 novel Its Superman by Tom De Haven.

In the Superman mythos, Byrne wrote Clark Kent as having a more aggressive and extroverted personality than previously depicted, even making him a top high-school football player. Byrne came up with explanations for how Supermans disguise works, such as the public simply does not realize that he has a secret identity since he is unmasked, that Superman would vibrate his face via his super speed in order to blur his image to photographers, and having Kent keep a weight training set around to explain how the human and presumably weaker Kent could have a frame as massive as Supermans. Byrnes Superman felt that his deepest roots were on Earth, and that his home planet of "Krypton is anathema to him".<ref name="AH"/>

The origin and early career of Byrnes version of Superman debuted in the six-issue miniseries The Man of Steel (comics) The Man of Steel (July–Sept. 1986), the first issue of which was marketed with two different covers illustrated by Byrne, the first use of variant covers by the American comics industry.<ref>{{cite web url= http://www.cbr.com/comic-book-questions-answered-what-was-the-first-variant-cover/ title= Comic Book Questions Answered: What Was the First Variant Cover? first= Brian last= Cronin date= April 24, 2008 publisher= Comic Book Resources archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161001114902/http://www.cbr.com/comic-book-questions-answered-what-was-the-first-variant-cover/ archivedate= October 1, 2016 deadurl= no df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Byrne penciled the six-issue DC Universe crossover miniseries Legends (comics) Legends (Nov. 1986 – May 1987) during this time.<ref>Manning, "1980s", in Dolan, p.  221. "DCs next big crossover showcased John Byrnes pencils on all six of the miniseries issues. Entitled Legends, this new limited series was plotted by writer John Ostrander and scripted by Len Wein...By the series end, the stage was set for several new ongoing titles, including...the Suicide Squad, as well as the Justice League."</ref> He wrote and drew two monthly Superman titles with the heros present-day adventures: a new Superman vol. 2 Superman title beginning with issue #1 (January 1987)<ref>Manning, "1980s", in Dolan, p. 226. "For the second time in his history, Supermans self-titled comic saw a first issue...a new series was introduced...written and drawn by the prolific Byrne."</ref> and Action Comics, in which, beginning with issue #584, Superman teamed up with other DC characters. The original Superman book was renamed Adventures of Superman (comic book) The Adventures of Superman starting with issue #424 and was initially written by Marv Wolfman and drawn by Jerry Ordway, but the writing chores were taken over by Byrne after a year from issues #436–442 and 444. As 1988 marked the 50th anniversary year of Supermans creation, Byrne did more Superman-related projects while working on the core Superman monthly titles at the same time: he wrote the prestige format graphic novel, Superman: The Earth Stealers and three separate four-issue miniseries: The World of Krypton, The World of Metropolis, and The World of Smallville. He supplied the cover art for the March 14, 1988 issue of Time (magazine) Time magazine<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19880314,00.html  title=Superman at 50  date=March 14, 1988  location=New York, New York  work=Time (magazine) Time  accessdate=December 26, 2011  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109134305/http://www.time.com/time/covers/0%2C16641%2C19880314%2C00.html  archivedate=January 9, 2012  deadurl=no df=mdy-all}}</ref> and an interior spread featuring Superman, where his pencils were inked by Ordway. 

After his initial run on the Superman titles from 1986-1988, Byrne would make a return as a guest inker on Adventures of Superman Annual #2 and Superman vol. 2 Superman #50 in 1990. He would return doing a Superman Elseworlds story as writer & artist in Action Comics Annual #6 in 1994. In 2004 Superman: True Brit, an Elseworlds story, was a collaboration with former Monty Python member John Cleese and Kim Johnson, with art by Byrne and inker Mark Farmer. Byrne returned to draw Superman in Action Comics #827–835, working with writer Gail Simone, from 2005-2006. 

Byrne spent about two years on the Superman titles before leaving. His dissatisfaction stemmed from his perception that there was a lack of "conscious support" for him at DC. Furthering the rift between the company and the artist was the fact that the version of Superman which DC licensed for merchandising was contrary to Byrnes representation in the comic books.<ref name="CBR2000" />

==Return to Marvel==

===Star Brand===

In 1986, Marvel began publication of a new line of superhero titles created by then-Editor-in-Chief Jim Shooter, which took place in a continuum removed from the Marvel Universe proper, called the New Universe.  In 1987, the New Universe line saw a revamp under new Editor-in-Chief Tom DeFalco, and Byrne took over writing and art-breakdowns on the lines flagship title, Star Brand (renamed The Star Brand during Byrnes term on the book). Byrnes run started with issue #11 and continued until the series cancellation eight issues later upon Marvels discontinuation of the New Universe line.

===Avengers West Coast===
In 1989, after leaving Superman, Byrne returned to work on a number of titles for Marvel Comics. His work on West Coast Avengers<ref>DeFalco "1980s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 240: "Writer/artist John Byrne produced the story arc that came to be known as Vision Quest that ran through The West Coast Avengers #42-45."</ref> (issues #42–57, soon renamed Avengers West Coast) was contingent on his being allowed to do what he called "my Vision story".<ref name="CBR2000" /> The Vision (Marvel Comics) Vision was a long-standing Marvel superhero and member of The Avengers (comic book) The Avengers, an Android (robot) android originally created by the villain Ultron constructed with the body of the original Human Torch (Golden Age) Human Torch. The Vision went on to join the team, marry his teammate the Scarlet Witch, and father two children by her. Byrne radically changed this, revealing that Ultron lied about the Visions creation. The android Human Torch was found and joined the WCA. The Vision was disassembled and stripped of his emotions. The couples twins were revealed to be pieces of the soul of the demon Mephisto. In addition to these changes, Byrnes run is remembered for the introduction of the Great Lakes Avengers, an eclectic group of new superheroes.<ref>DeFalco "1980s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 241: "Writer/artist John Byrne took a tongue-in-cheek approach to superheroics."</ref>

===The Sensational She-Hulk===
During She-Hulks tenure with the Fantastic Four, she appeared in Marvel Graphic Novel #18 (Nov. 1985) in a story titled The Sensational She-Hulk, which Byrne wrote and illustrated.<ref>DeFalco "1980s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 241</ref>

On the request of editor Mark Gruenwald, Byrne wrote and drew a new series in 1989, The Sensational She-Hulk (maintaining the 1985 graphic novels title). Gruenwald directed that it be significantly different from the characters previous series, The Savage She-Hulk.<ref name="FAQAborted">{{cite web url=http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=3&T1=Questions+about+Aborted+Storylines#129  title=Questions About Aborted Storylines  first=John  last=Byrne  date=December 11, 2004  publisher=Byrne Robotics  archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AgcZx7th?url=http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID%3D3%26T1%3DQuestions%2Babout%2BAborted%2BStorylines  archivedate=September 15, 2012  deadurl=no  accessdate=September 14, 2012 df=mdy-all}}</ref> Byrnes take was comedic and the She-Hulk, who was aware she was in a comic book, regularly broke the fourth wall, developing a love-hate relationship with her artist/writer by criticizing his storylines, drawing style, character development, etc. Byrne left the book after writing and drawing the first eight issues. Byrne was asked for input on writer Dwayne McDuffies She-Hulk: Ceremony limited series, and according to Byrne, most of his objections to the story and notations of errors were ignored, and his editor, Bobbie Chase, "was rewriting my stuff to bring it into line with" the story in Ceremony. Upon complaining to DeFalco, Byrne says he was fired from his series.<ref name="FAQAborted" /> He later returned to write and draw issues #31–50 under new editor Renée Witterstaetter.

===Namor, the Sub-Mariner===
Byrne started a new series, Namor, the Sub-Mariner in April 1990.<ref>Manning, Matthew K. "1990s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 248: "Comics superstar John Byrne revamped the classic Marvel character Namor in this new series that he both wrote and drew."</ref> Byrnes take on the undersea antihero Namor cast him as the head of a surface company, Oracle, Inc., in order to help keep the ocean unpolluted, and had Namor involved in corporate intrigue. After writing and drawing the book for 25 issues, Byrne told editor Terry Kavanagh that he was starting to feel constrained on the book and thought having a different artist might inspire him to a fresh approach.<ref name="back91">{{cite journal last=Lantz first=James Heath  title=Prince Namor the Sub-Mariner: Scion of the Deep or Royal Pain? journal=Back Issue! issue=91 pages=56–59  publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing date=September 2016 location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> Kavanagh suggested newcomer Jae Lee, and Byrne continued as strictly writer of the book up through issue #32. Byrne later said he has great fondness for the title character and was unhappy that circumstances forced him to leave the series.<ref name="back91"/>

===Iron Man===
Byrne took over writing Iron Man for issues #258–277 (July 1990-Feb. 1992), drawn by John Romita Jr. and later by Paul Ryan (cartoonist) Paul Ryan. Byrne launched a second "Iron Man#Armor Wars Armor Wars" story arc, restored the Mandarin (comics) Mandarin as a major Iron Man nemesis, and featured the 1950s "pre-superhero Marvel" monster Fin Fang Foom. During the course of his run, Byrne became the first writer to Retroactive continuity retcon Iron Mans origin, removing explicit ties to the Vietnam War (while maintaining a Southeast Asia setting), and linking Wong-Chu, the man who captured Tony Stark, to the Mandarin.<ref>{{cite comic  writer= Byrne, John penciller= Paul Ryan (cartoonist) Ryan, Paul inker= Bob Wiacek Wiacek, Bob story= The Persistence of Memory title= Iron Man issue= 267 date= April 1991}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic  writer= Byrne, John penciller= Ryan, Paul inker= Wiacek, Bob story= First Blood title= Iron Man issue= 268 date= May 1991}}</ref>

==Creator-owned works==
In the early 1990s, Byrne began creating a series of original, creator-owned works for publisher Dark Horse Comics. This was during a general trend in the industry for established creators working for Marvel and DC to bring their original works to other publishers or create their own companies to publish the works themselves (one prominent example is Image Comics). A number of these creators, including Byrne, Frank Miller (comics) Frank Miller, Mike Mignola, and Art Adams, banded together to form the Legend (comic imprint) Legend imprint at Dark Horse.

Byrnes first title for Dark Horse was Next Men, a work he considered darker and more realistic than his previous work. The Next Men were five young people who were the product of a secret government experiment. Byrne said, "I thought I would see what I could do with superheroes in the real world&nbsp;" and "[e]xplore the impact their existence would have."<ref name="CBR2000"/> Byrnes other Dark Horse titles were Babe (comics) Babe, and Danger Unlimited, an all-age readers book about a team of heroes in the future fighting an alien occupation of Earth.

The Next Men lasted until issue 30 in 1994, when Byrne ended the series, intending to return "in no more than six months." Byrne says he "did not count on...the virtual collapse of the whole comic book industry, which seemed to occur at just the time I put Next Men on the shelf...In the present, very depressed marketplace, I dont feel Next Men would have much chance, so I leave the book hibernating until such time as the market improves."<ref name="CBR2000"/>

IDW Publishing revived John Byrnes Next Men in 2010 following a series of trade paperbacks that collected the first series. The original storyline that had a cliffhanger ending in 1995 was continued.

==Later career==
In later years, Byrne has worked on titles for Marvel, DC, and other publishers, including the 1992 prestige format graphic novel Green Lantern: Ganthets Tale with science fiction author Larry Niven at DC. In 1989, Byrne wrote Batman #433-435 (May–July 1989)<ref>{{cite book last= Manning first= Matthew K. last2=Dougall first2=Alastair, ed. chapter= 1980s title= Batman: A Visual History publisher= Dorling Kindersley year= 2014 location= London, United Kingdom page= 178 isbn= 978-1465424563 quote= Writer John Byrne teamed with artist Jim Aparo for this three-issue arc.}}</ref> and in the following year produced a Stereoscopy 3-D graphic novel with 3-D effects by Ray Zone.<ref>Manning, "1990s", in Dolan, p. 247. "The Caped Crusader leaped off the pages in all his red-and-blue glory <!-- a reference to the colors used in the 3-D process -->in this over-sized eighty-page special crafted by 3-D expert Ray Zone...[for] an all-new tale written and illustrated by John Byrne."</ref> He returned to the X-Men franchise at Marvel from 1991 to 1992, succeeding longtime writer Chris Claremont, who left after 17 years working on the various X-Men related titles. Byrnes return as the new writer was brief, as he only scripted Uncanny X-Men issues #281–285 and 288 with artist Whilce Portacio, and X-Men: Legacy X-Men issues #4–5 with artist Jim Lee. In 1995, Byrne wrote and drew the Marvel/DC intercompany crossover Darkseid vs. Galactus: The Hunger, which also featured the Jack Kirby creations the Silver Surfer and the New Gods.

He wrote and drew another of DCs signature series, the long-running Wonder Woman, from 1995 to 1998. During that time, he elevated the super-heroine to the status of goddess<ref>Manning, "1990s", in Dolan, p. 280. "It seemed Wonder Woman had breathed her last in Wonder Woman #124, thanks to writer and artist John Byrne."</ref> who then ascended to Mount Olympus as the Goddess of Truth. Byrne then spotlighted supporting characters such as Hippolyta (DC Comics) Queen Hippolyta in their own adventures but restored the series status quo in his last issue.<ref>Manning, "1990s", in Dolan, p. 284. "Writer/artist John Byrne was leaving Wonder Woman...But before he could move on to other projects, there was one final thing Byrne still had to do: bring Wonder Woman back from the dead."</ref> He additionally took over New Gods vol. 4 at the end of 1996, as writer-artist of issues #12–15, continuing with it as the series was rebooted with a new #1 as Fourth World (comics) Jack Kirbys Fourth World. That ran 20 issues from 1997 to 1998. During his tenure on the New Gods, Byrne was writer of the four-issue miniseries crossover Genesis (DC Comics) Genesis, a story line published weekly by DC Comics in August 1997. The series was drawn by Ron Wagner and Joe Rubinstein. Byrne wrote a Wonder Woman prose novel, Wonder Woman: Gods and Goddesses (1997, Prima Lifestyles, {{ISBN 0-7615-0483-4}}).

In the series Spider-Man: Chapter One, Byrne retold some of Spider-Mans earliest adventures, changing some key aspects.<ref>{{cite book last = Cowsill first = Alan last2= Gilbert first2= Laura, ed. chapter= 1990s title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging publisher = Dorling Kindersley year = 2012 location= London, United Kingdom page = 245 isbn = 978-0756692360 quote= John Byrne briefly updated Spider-Mans origin for a new generation of readers in December [1998].}}</ref> In late 1998, Byrne became writer of the flagship series, The Amazing Spider-Man, at the end of the series with issue #440, by which time Marvel had decided to relaunch the book. The "last" issue of The Amazing Spider-Man was #441 (November 1998), with Marvel re-initiating the series with a new issue #1 (Jan. 1999) with Howard Mackie as writer and Byrne on pencils.<ref>Cowsill "1990s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 246: "This new series heralded a fresh start for the web-slingers adventures."</ref> Byrne penciled issues #1–18 (from 1999 to 2000) and wrote #13–14. In 1999, Byrne, working with artist Ron Garney, wrote the first seven issues of a new Hulk (comics) Hulk series,<ref>Manning "1990s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 294: "Bruce Banner took to the road in an attempt to escape his past in this new series by writer John Byrne and artist Ron Garney."</ref> as well as the annual publications summer annual.

From 1999 to 2001, Byrne returned to the X-Men to write and draw X-Men: The Hidden Years<ref>Manning "1990s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 295: "[The gap between The X-Men #66 in 1970 and Giant-Size X-Men #1 in 1975] left fans to wonder what the originals were up to in all that time, a question that writer/artist John Byrne decided to answer in this new ongoing series."</ref> which ran for 22 issues. Byrne explained the titles cancellation by saying, "I was officially informed yesterday that, despite the fact that they are still profitable, several redundant X-Titles are being axed." This disagreement factored in his decision to no longer work for Marvel Comics.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=13522  title=John Byrne Leaves Marvel  first=Beau  last=Yarbrough  date=November 15, 2000  publisher=Comic Book Resources  archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Agead5VS?url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page%3Darticle%26id%3D13522  archivedate=September 15, 2012  deadurl=yes  accessdate=September 14, 2012  quote=I was officially informed yesterday that, despite the fact that they are still profitable, several redundant X-Titles are being axed." df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Like X-Men: The Hidden Years, some other works of this period involved characters and events in time periods other than the present and, in some cases, considered "skipped over" (Marvel: The Lost Generation), or alternate timelines (DCs Superman & Batman: Generations);<ref>Manning "1990s" in Dougall, p. 239: "Writer/artist John Byrne returned to the Man of Steel and paired him with the Caped Crusader in this four-issue prestige format Elseworlds series."</ref> a feature some of these have in common is to have characters who actually age during the course of the series, which is uncommon for characters in ongoing comics.

In early 2003, Byrne spent ten weeks as guest penciler on the syndicated comic strip newspaper strip Funky Winkerbean. Byrne did this as a favor for Winkerbeans creator, Tom Batiuk, who was recovering from foot surgery.<ref>Tom Batiuk Batiuk, Tom, statement in {{cite web first=M.K., ed.  last=Lively  url=http://www.angelfire.com/va/funkyw/stuff.html  title=Funky Stuff  publisher=The Unofficial Funky Winkerbean Fan Page  date=April 2003  archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AgfLWms3?url=http://www.angelfire.com/va/funkyw/stuff.html  archivedate=September 15, 2012  deadurl=no  accessdate=September 14, 2012  quote=When some recent foot surgery among other things caused us to get a little behind in our schedule, I asked John Byrne, one of the top comic book artists in the business today and an artist whose work Ive long admired, to step in and do a guest shot sharing the art duties with my Funky characters for a few weeks. df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Most of his work in the first decade of the new millennium was for DC Comics: JLA (comics) JLA (issues #94–99 in 2004, co-writing and illustrating the "Tenth Circle" story arc, reuniting with his Uncanny X-Men writer Chris Claremont and with Jerry Ordway as inker), Doom Patrol, Blood of the Demon, a five-issue arc of JLA Classified. He penciled an issue of Hawkman (vol. 4) #26 in May 2004. Superman: True Brit was a collaboration with former Monty Python member John Cleese and Kim Johnson, with art by Byrne and inker Mark Farmer.<ref>Cowsill, Alan, "2000s", in Dolan, p. 315. "Comedy legend John Cleese joined forces with artist John Byrne, inker Mark Farmer and writer Kim Johnson for a unique take on the Superman story.  Superman: True Brit saw Kal-Els rocketship land on a farm...in the UK."</ref> Byrne returned to draw Superman in Action Comics #827–835, working with writer Gail Simone, from 2005-2006. Afterward, Simone and Byrne reteamed to launch Atom (comics) The All-New Atom series in 2006, with Byrne pencilling the first three issues.

For publisher IDW, Byrne worked on the superhero series FX (comics) FX #1–6, written by Wayne Osborne, starting with the March 2008 issue. His other projects for the publisher include stories in the Star Trek universe and the Angel (1999 TV series) Angel (TV series character) universe.

In 1981, Jack Kirby began speaking publicly about his belief that hed been deprived of fair credit and money while creating the majority of Marvels top characters.  Byrne wrote an editorial declaring himself "proud" to be a "company man," and arguing that all creators should "live within the rules while theyre around." Steve Gerber and Kirby lampooned Byrnes position in Destroyer Duck, drawing him as a character called Booster Cogburn, possessing a removable spine and existing only to serve as a cog in the mammoth corporation that owned him.<ref>Destroyer Duck, Eclipse Comics, 1981–83, issues #1–5; the letters page of #5 discusses the physical likeness and similarity of names, and acknowledges that the character is a response to comments Byrne made in the fan press.</ref> Erik Larsen created a villain in the 1990s for his Savage Dragon and the Freak Force series Johnny Redbeard/the Creator, who parodies Byrne; a massive cranium with atrophied appendages, he can bestow superpowers indiscriminately.<ref>Evans, Eric. "What Kirby Wanted", foreword to Savage Dragon Companion #1 (Image Comics, July 2002), p. 5.</ref>

In 1982, during a panel discussion at the Dallas Fantasy Fair, Byrne made disparaging comments about longtime comics writer and one-time Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Roy Thomas that were published in The Comics Journal #75 (Sept. 1982), Thomas threatened a libel suit if Byrne did not apologize. In a letter printed in The Comics Journal #82 (July 1983), Byrne retracted his statements, claiming he was only repeating information from others, writing, "I acted only in the office of a parrot."

Gail Simone, who worked with Byrne on The All New Atom in 2006, described Byrne as "very opinionated; a lot of artists are opinionated, and Im okay with that. Actually, I think John Byrne is brilliant and his forceful personality is part of that."<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=7985  title=CCI XTRA: Spotlight on Gail Simone  accessdate=September 14, 2012  authorlink=Jim MacQuarrie  last=MacQuarrie  first=Jim  date=July 27, 2006  archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AggXAgxt?url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page%3Darticle%26old%3D1%26id%3D7985  archivedate=September 15, 2012  deadurl=no  publisher=Comic Book Resources df=mdy-all}} (Archive requires scrolldown.)</ref>

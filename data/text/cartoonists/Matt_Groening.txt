He is the creator of the comic strip Life in Hell (1977–2012) and the television series The Simpsons (1989–present), Futurama (1999–2003, 2008–2013), and Disenchantment (TV series) Disenchantment (2018–present). The Simpsons is the longest-running U.S. primetime-television series in history and the longest-running U.S. animated series and sitcom.

Groening made his first professional cartoon sale of Life in Hell to the avant-garde Wet (magazine) Wet magazine in 1978. At its peak, the cartoon was carried in 250 weekly newspapers. Life in Hell caught the attention of James L. Brooks. In 1985, Brooks contacted Groening with the proposition of working in animation for the Fox Broadcasting Company Fox variety show The Tracey Ullman Show. Originally, Brooks wanted Groening to adapt his Life in Hell characters for the show. Fearing the loss of ownership rights, Groening decided to create something new and came up with a cartoon family, the Simpson family, and named the members after his own parents and sisters—while Bart Simpson Bart was an anagram of the word brat. The shorts would be spun off into their own series The Simpsons, which has since aired List of The Simpsons episodes {{:The Simpsons}} episodes. In 1997, Groening and former Simpsons writer David X. Cohen developed Futurama, an animated series about life in the year 3000, which premiered in 1999, running for four years on Fox, then picked up by Comedy Central for additional seasons. Groening developed a new series for Netflix titled Disenchantment (TV series) Disenchantment, which premiered in August 2018.

Groening has won 12 Primetime Emmy Awards, ten for The Simpsons and two for Futurama as well as a British Comedy Awards British Comedy Award for "outstanding contribution to comedy" in 2004. In 2002, he won the National Cartoonist Society Reuben Award for his work on Life in Hell. He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on February 14, 2012.

Although The Tracey Ullman Show was not a big hit,<ref name="ortved p72">{{Harvnb Ortved 2007  p=72}}.</ref> the popularity of the shorts led to a half-hour spin-off in 1989.

The series quickly became a worldwide phenomenon, to the surprise of many. Groening said: "Nobody thought The Simpsons was going to be a big hit. It sneaked up on everybody."<ref name="laweekly"/> The Simpsons was co-developed by Groening, Brooks, and Sam Simon, a writer-producer with whom Brooks had worked on previous projects. Groening and Simon, however, did not get along<ref name="ortved p72"/> and were often in conflict over the show;<ref name=latimesmag/> Groening once described their relationship as "very contentious."<ref name="nytimes"/> Simon eventually left the show in 1993 over creative differences.<ref name="ew">{{cite web  title=Conan on being left out of "Simpsons Movie"  work=Entertainment Weekly  url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20035285_20035331_20046980,00.html  last=Snierson  first=Dan  date=July 18, 2007  accessdate=September 4, 2007}}</ref>

Although Groening has pitched a number of spin-offs from The Simpsons, those attempts have been unsuccessful. In 1994, Groening and other Simpsons producers pitched a live-action spin-off about Krusty the Clown (with Dan Castellaneta playing the lead role), but were unsuccessful in getting it off the ground.<ref name=avclub/><ref name="npr">From a radio interview with Groening that aired on the [https://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=13&prgDate=22-Apr-98 April 22, 1998 edition] of Fresh Air on National Public Radio NPR.

In 1995, Groening got into a major disagreement with Brooks and other Simpsons producers over "A Star Is Burns", a fictional crossover crossover episode with The Critic, an animated show also produced by Brooks and staffed with many former Simpsons crew members. Groening claimed that he feared viewers would "see it as nothing but a pathetic attempt to advertise The Critic at the expense of The Simpsons," and was concerned about the possible implication that he had created or produced The Critic.<ref name="flux">{{Harvnb Paul 1995}}.</ref> He requested his name be taken off the episode.<ref name="latimes">{{cite web title=Matt Groenings Reaction to The Critics First Appearance on The Simpsons  work=Los Angeles Times  url=http://www.critic.nohomers.net/Special_Extras_Matt_Groening_Reaction.html  last=Brennan  first=Judy  date=March 3, 1995  accessdate=September 4, 2007  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070831075427/http://critic.nohomers.net/Special_Extras_Matt_Groening_Reaction.html  archivedate=August 31, 2007  df= }}</ref>

===Futurama===
{{Main Futurama}}
After spending a few years researching science fiction, Groening got together with Simpsons writer/producer David X. Cohen (known as David S. Cohen at the time) in 1997 and developed Futurama, an animated series about life in the year 3000.<ref name="motherjones"/><ref name="theface">{{cite journal last=Needham  first=Alex  url=//www.frcr.com/library/the_face1.html  title=Nice Planet...Well Take It!  journal=The Face  issue=33  date=October 1999  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000824051707/http://www.frcr.com/library/the_face1.html  archivedate=August 24, 2000  df= }}</ref> By the time they pitched the series to Fox in April 1998, Groening and Cohen had composed many characters and plot (narrative) storylines; Groening claimed they had gone "overboard" in their discussions.<ref name="theface"/> Groening described trying to get the show on the air as "by far the worst experience of [his] grown-up life."<ref name="motherjones"/> The show premiered on March 28, 1999. Groenings writing credits for the show are for the premiere episode, "Space Pilot 3000" (co-written with Cohen), "Rebirth (Futurama) Rebirth" (story) and "In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela" (story).

After four years on the air, the show was canceled by Fox. In a situation similar to Family Guy, however, strong DVD sales and very stable ratings on Adult Swim brought Futurama back to life. When Comedy Central began negotiating for the rights to air Futurama reruns, Fox suggested that there was a possibility of also creating new episodes. When Comedy Central committed to sixteen new episodes, it was decided that four straight-to-DVD films – Futurama: Benders Big Score Benders Big Score (2007), Futurama: The Beast with a Billion Backs The Beast with a Billion Backs (2008), Futurama: Benders Game Benders Game (2008) and Futurama: Into the Wild Green Yonder Into the Wild Green Yonder (2009) – would be produced.<ref name="Katz">{{cite interview  last=Katz  first=Claudia  subjectlink=Claudia Katz  interviewer=Evan Jacobs  title=EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: Claudia Katz on Futurama the Movie: Benders Big Score  url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/NEyTuBCyy6XECD  date=November 16, 2007  accessdate=June 9, 2009}}</ref><ref name="DVDMovieAnnounced">{{cite web  url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/matt-groening,13984/  title=Matt Groening  author=Rabin, Nathan  publisher=The A.V.

Since no new Futurama projects were in production, the movie Into the Wild Green Yonder was designed to stand as the Futurama series finale.
